 The message you are about to change, is not written by you, or at least not

 Copy and Move never changes the content of the affected message(s). Move
 deletes the original message(s), so be careful when using this feature.

 If you select Forward, you are asked for the destination area, and you will
 be able to change the header data. A template-defined message is inserted at
 the top of the message.

*B 3006,Find String
 <Alt-F / Alt-Z (Header only)>                                  ^Reader Keys^

 By default, GoldED searches forward (next messages), but by preceeding the
 search string with a '-', the search goes backwards (previous messages).

 By default the '<', '>' and ':' search commands are enabled, so that GoldED
 searches all header fields. However, when one of these options are actually
 used, the search is limited to those only.

  -   Search backward            Must be first character, if used
  +   Search forward (default)   Must be first character, if used
  !   Logic not (match when NOT found)
  &   Logic and (match this AND that)
  |   Logic or (match this OR that)
  <   Match "from" header field
  >   Match "to header field
  :   Match "subject" header field
  #   Match message body (but not any control lines)
  %   Match kludges/headerlines
  =   Match case-sensitive (defaults to not case-sensitive)
  '   Do not match. Place after an option
*P

  .   Match tagline
  _   Match tearline
  *   Match origin line
  @   Match signature
  ^^   Toggle match - Place after an option
  ?p  Plain search (default)
  ?r  Regex search
  ?w  Wildcard search
  ?f  Fuzzy search with one mismatch allowed
  ?f2 Fuzzy search with two mismatches allowed
  ?f3 Fuzzy search with three mismatches allowed

  You can enclose a pattern string with double ("") or single ('')
  quotes if you want to match a sentence with spaces or which contains
  option characters.

  The backslash is a literal-escape character. If a backslash is
  found, the next character is treated as part of the pattern, not as
  an option character. Use this for example to search for a sentence
  with quotes and spaces.
*P

  The first set of option characters on a search expression line is
  used as the "global default". The next set of option characters is
  bound to the following pattern. A pattern is completed by the end of
  the line or by the logic options '&' or '|'.

  Some examples:
  To search for the authors name, allowing most common misspellings:
    ?f1 odinn     (matches odin, odinn, oddin, odiin etc)

  To search for OS/2 and Warp 4: OS/2 & "Warp 4"

  To search for Odinn or Dirk in the from-line: < Odinn | Dirk

  To search for zip file announcements: ?w "*.zip*"    (NOT ! ?w *.zip*)

  Some regular expression searches:
    ?r "Warp *4"    (matches both "Warp 4" and "Warp4")
    ?r "OS/*2" & "Warp *4"

 If you decide to write to the Print Device, you must make sure that it is

 calls to send the data to the device, and if the device fails for some
 reason, you will get ugly Dos messages and prompts plastered all over the
 nice GoldED screen.

 GoldED has detected that your Hudson message base is rapidly approaching a
 very dangerous size. If you do not run a packing utility very soon, you risk
 permanent damage to your message base.

 The absolute maximum size for your message base is a 16 MB big MSGTXT.BBS
 file (65536 records of 256 bytes). This is approximately 16000 messages of
 average size.

 The GOLDED.CFG keyword HUDSONSIZEWARN defines the size when GoldED starts

 You are dangerously low on memory.

 If you proceed now, you may get kicked out later with an "Out of memory"
 error. Watch the memory meter on the status line - if it gets under 20-30k,
 you may experience strange lockups.

 To correct this situation, run GoldED with more free memory or use the -O
 commandline option or GEDCMD environment variable to decrease the overlay
 size.
