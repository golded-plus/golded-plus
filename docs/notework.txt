               Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.5, /snapshot/
______________________________________________________________________

Legend: "-" - bugfix, "+" - new feature, "!" - important modification.
______________________________________________________________________

- Don't change actual charset table with spellchecker enabled when
  "IgnoreCharset YES" in the config file.

- Fix segfault on wide terminal with long tearline, tagline or origin.

- The conflict to standard function pow() in Visual Studio 2010 is
  eliminated.

+ In the Spell Checking feature simultaneous may use a several
  dictionnaries. The token SCheckerDefLang accepts a list of
  dictionaries delimited with space. Patch from Semen Panevin,
  2:5025/121@fidonet

! Fix SOUP and QWK initialisation. (Early Golded+ used buffer with
  value of last parameter in a config instead of a area name).

! Golded+ more do not try to read soupnewsrcfile at start if the file
  not specified in the config. (Fix a crash in Visual Studio build.)

! When buffer overflow causes in string, Golded+ replace broken string
  with "ERROR" or "ERROR, see log!". If you look these strings, please
  send a file "golded.log" to developers or create ticket in bugtrack
  and attach this log file. Direct URL to create ticket:
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=2942&atid=102942
  (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=2942&atid=102942)

- Many mistakes of work in the memory, leading to emergency end of
  Golded+ in x64 GCC 4.x builds are corrected. Thank Anton Gorlov
  2:5059/37 for debugging and reporting about bugs.

+ Gentoo ebuild is added. Thank for Semen Panevin, 2:5025/121@fidonet.

+ You may run make with several parameters to specify variant of build.

! Semen Panevin, 2:5025/121@fidonet has extracted all code related
  with library ncurses in separate library. Now messages of Goldnode
  and RDDT are visible on the console of unix-like OS.

+ Date of last change of sources automatically remains in a files
  srcdate.h and golded.spec. Date from srcdate.h uses for forming
  version string for Golded+ snapshot.

! Now Golded+ outputs errors of reading of a config in stderr instead
  stdout. To look only errors, the user unix-like OS can use a
  redirection stderr means of the command processor, for example:
  (view) `gedlnx 2| less` or (save to file) `gedlnx 2>gedlnxerr.txt`.

- Check length of charset name (16 characters max): fix buffer
  overflow.

- Error in parser @-macro is fixed: macro in end of line are ignored
  before this fix.

- If not defined any URLHANDLER and key "READpeekURLs" is pressed,
  Golded+ does not trap now (segmentation fault fixed).

+ New token IL_PEEKINFONOHANDLER for goldlang.cfg (message
  " URL handler are not defined in config file! "

! Keyboard shortcats is changed: now Ctrl-Backspace deletes char to
  left and Ctrl-W deletes word to left. (Workaround to Ctrl-Backspace
  detection bug in Linux.)

! If TEMPPATH is pointed to unexisted directory the Golded+ displays
  message about invalid TEMPPATH and does nothing on UU-decoding, on
  importing result of shell command, on calling extern utility and
  on write message to file.  Early Golded+ displayed message like
  "Can't write to file /temp/D4FC54QW" or aborted.

+ New token IL_TMPINVALIDPATH for goldlang.cfg (message "Invalid path
  for temporary files (TEMPPATH) - do nothing").

+ Script openbsd-vt220.sh to create terminfo file for OpenBSD console
  from Dmitri Zubko 2:465/312.

- Decrease jitter for clock in status line. Patch from Nick Voronin

! (UNIX only) Changed sequience for config file search in unix-like OS.
  New order is:
  1 - ~/fido/etc/
  2 - ~/ftn/etc/
  3 - ~/.golded/
  4 - current (running) directory
  Removed from search order: a directory /usr/local/etc/ and the directory
  where is gedlnx binary.

- Reverce fix for charset level processing (CHRS kludge). Translate all
  levels. (See Snapshot for the January 14, 2006.)

= Snapshot for the Nov 16, 2006.

+ Cashed last opened thread, that greatly increase tree opening speed,
  especially useful for READGotoThNextUnread.

+ When moving from recyclebin, area from AREA: kludge is selected by default.

- uudecoder: now are skipped all lines which follows line that starts
  with "sum -r/size ".

  goldkeys.cfg for \" and \\ and change them to \\" and \\\\
  accordingly before upgrading.

= Snapshot for the December 24, 2003.

  file.

- Fixed newly introduced bug in copying/moving Opus mail.

- Fixed CRC16 routine for Synchronet fields updating.

- Fixed X-Comment-To/X-To creation.

! Some code was significantly reworked. May cause a lot of problems,
  but should be more flexible. If there are new problems with reading
  areafiles, adding extra kludges on copying messages, etc. appear
  please report.

- Fixed Crashmail II/CrashEcho config parser: when echo without
  description was followed after passthru echo with description the
  last one used.

+ Added -pass switch support to Fidoconfig parser.

- Fixed bug in HPT config parser: areas which was not explicitly
  given messagebase type was omited.

+ Added new configuration keywords to main configuration file:

  WRITEHEADER <YES/NO/ONLY> - default setting for Write->Header
  setting, defaults to yes. Can be used in Random System Group.

  STRIPHTML <YES/NO> - activate quick-n-dirty HTML-tag stripper. It
  known to fail in some cases but more likely will not be improoved.
  The keyword may be used in Random System Group. Defaults - NO.
  NOTE: Strip HTML mode forces quoted-printable decoding.

+ Added new configuration keywords to keys configuration file:

  READSTRIPHTML        - Strip HTML tags
  READSHOWHTML         - Show HTML tags
  READTOGGLEHTML       - Toggle HTML tags display mode

  The keywords listed below are just duplicates for corresponding
  toggles. They are added mostly for use in macros (untested):

  AREAMARK
  AREAUNMARK
  LISTMARK
  LISTUNMARK
  LISTWIDESUBJ
  LISTNARROWSUBJ
  READSHOWKLUDGE
  READHIDEKLUDGE
  READSHOWHIDDEN
  READHIDEHIDDEN
  READSHOWHIDDKLUD
  READHIDEHIDDKLUD

  READSTYLESSTRIP
  READTWITSSHOW
  READTWITSBLANK
  READTWITSSKIP
  READTWITSIGNORE
  READTWITSKILL
  READSHOWQUOTE
  READHIDEQUOTE

- X-Mailreader should not duplicate now on message changing (not
  tested).

- Better support for long tearlines are added. Now long tearlines with
  QuoteCtrl set to not quote tearlines no longer get quoted.

+ Added quote display mode to the statusbar (Q letter).

- More fixes to uu/xxdecoder: now sections which follows with the
  "end" properly decoded; if name contained tilde inside it also broke
  multisection UUE decoding.

- Fixed FWD kludges encoding.

- Hooks to the delete and move messages added for the read-only areas.

- Fixed SEEN-BY invalidation.

- GoldED+ should now properly prepend data/subs path to the Synchronet
  bases, so copying of msgs.cnf to that directory should not be done
  anymore in order to make Synchronet areafile reader working.

- Fixed the warning line if SeqMsgId set to MAYBE.

- GoldED+/W32 will not issue warning about too long commandline under
  NT.

+ Added Husky compatible MSGID generation algorithm. The following
  keywords are added for configuration:

  SeqMsgId Yes/No/Maybe
  Yes   - Use SeqMsgId algorithm
  No    - Do not use SeqMsgId algorithm
  Maybe - Use SeqMsgId algorithm if SeqDir is set explicitly (default)

  SeqDir pathname
  If SeqDir not explicitly defined and SeqMsgId is set, then SEQDIR
  environment variable will be used. Note that pathname mapping (by
  using MapPath rules) only occurs when SeqDir defined explicitly.

  SeqOutRun num[y][d][h][w][m]
  SeqOutRun defines maximum "run-away" time for the MSGID. If not
  defined explicitly, then SEQOUT environment variable is used. If
  SEQOUT is also not set, then default value equals to 3 years is
  used.
  The num defines number in seconds if neither one of modificators
  is in use. The following modificators can be used:
  y - year
  d - day
  h - hour
  w - week
  m - month (31 days)

  Thanks to Alexander Reznikov for the patch.

- Fixed active messages counter for JAM messagebases if message
  restored by removing DEL attribute.

! Ignore RRq attribute. We will process only Cfm now: RRq should be
  processed by mailer/tosser/tracker according to the attribute
  intension.

- Convert internal codes to lowercase in Synchronet BBS parser before
  using them as pathname.

- Cosmetic fix in Goldnode: pad output with spaces.

- Previous fix on relative pathnames was incorrect. Now GoldED+
  changed to resolve problem. Seems to work properly now.

- Do not crash if problem to access MC clipboard (Linux specific).

- To fix problem with relative pathname in NODEPATH the Goldnode will
  write only filename in .gxl file. Most users should not notice this
  change at all.

- InternetReply should only affect netmail areas. Fixed.

- Fixed more bugs with block deletion undo.

+ OS/2 only: if environment variable PMWIN set to NO then GoldED+ will
  not try to use PMWIN functions.

- Fixed cosmetic bug in thread tree: line was painted incompletely.

- Fixed environment variables expansion recently broken.

- When reading pathnames from Maximus 3 areafile GoldED+ had not
  prepend Maximus path. Fixed.

- Fixed undo of the last removed line.

- Improved a bit speed for long messages handling.

- When deleting marked messages the pointer moved always on the
  previous message instead of the next in movement direction.

- Fixed some problems with readonly areas: it is now not possible to
  change messages in R/O areas, it is possible to set group of areas
  to R/O using ATTRIBUTES keyword in Random System Group.

- Fixed small reflow bug in message viewer.

- Fixed recently introduced bug with replying on gated messages in
  echo and following change of destination name. There's still some
  work to be done in this field.

- Due to the collisions in Squish hash when personal mail scan is
  requested, after the hash values are matched the name now compared
  with string in To field in messagebase. This will slow down a bit
  personal mail scan, but will produce proper detection of names (not
  tested).

- The names with NLS characters was improperly handled in JAM
  messagebases, should work properly now (not tested).

- When importing file the current filepath will be displayed at
  statusline.

- Fixed highlignting of url-like filenames.

! The changed mail will also be copied to the Areayouwroteto now.

- Fixed small bug in Maximus 3 config parser. Any more left?

- Another try to support MC clipboard.

- Once again Numlock was not taken into account for Del in Win9x (not
  tested).

- Fixed deadkey-space combinations in Win32 version.

- Compatibility fix for http://www.chat.ru/~tulser/clipbrd.zip. Though
  it is not GoldED+ fault.

- Some fixes for replying through the gate. If someone use
  "INTERNETREPLY NO" please report if it get broken with this changes.

! AREALISTGROUPORDER now supports #num format entries.

! You can now use area groups in the *SCAN* keywords: just prepend the
  '>' character before the group, i.e.:

  AREASCAN >#12
  AREASCANEXCL >G

- When calling unpacker the path to the area will be converted to the
  full qualified path.

! EditNewline now deletes the selected block.

- Fixed exit from the locked/non-existing JAM areas.

- Fixed small bug in UUE decoder which prevents unsorted multipart UUE
  from decoding.

- EchoAreaDefaults was not applied to the local areas. Fixed.

! Ctrl-R and Alt-Backspace in fields now toggles information between
  stored buffer and current value.

+ Added keyboard not redefinable assignments for clearing the whole
  field contents: Ctrl-Del, Ctrl-D, and Ctrl-Y.

- Cosmetic: URL highlighting now have lower priority then selection
  block in the editor.

- Fixed lastread problem after edit externutils (PGP, etc.).

- Oops, EchoAreaDefaults was not applied to the includes. Fixed.

+ Added EchoAreaDefaults support to Fidoconfig parser.

+ Synchronet configuration parser now will use short description
  instead of internal code as echoid for the Fidonet areas.

- Fixed keyboard macro handling broken somewhere in pre-1.1.5s.

- Fixed Synchronet configuration parser :-)

+ Added Synchronet configuration parser:

  Areafile Synchronet path\to\msgs.cnf

+ Added clipboard support for the input prompts. Since the selection
  keys are not available the action is performed on the whole line.

  Default assignments (which cannont be redefined -- sorry):

  Shift-Ins, Ctrl-V   Paste
  Shift-Del, Ctrl-X   Cut
  Ctrl-Ins, Ctrl-C    Copy

  In overwrite mode paste overwrites the whole input line otherwise
  inserts one line from the clipboard from the current position.

  Also added alias to Ctrl-R key - Alt-Backspace which reverts the
  input prompt to it's initial value.

+ Added Midnight Commander compatible clipboard support for UNIX
  version. Should only be available if "~/.cedit" directory exist at
  GoldED+ startup time. (not tested)

- Fixed problem with charset conversion on calling externutil with
  kludges shown and reload option set. You should have reverse charset
  table for this message (xlatlocalset to message charset) in order
  this fix to work.

- Fixed small bug in the Crahmail/Crashecho parser when the last
  address may left unread.

- Fixed various types of SMB corruption, especially on changing
  message or updating attrbutes.

- Fixed crash on hex-dumping empty SMB message.

- Fixed problem with non-emporting mail from SMB area.

! Updated SMBLib to the recent version.

+ Added patch by Vladimir V. Korablin for @notforward template token.
  The line containing this token is left only when message IS NOT
  a forward. This is "@forward"'s counterpart.

! If two AreaSep have the same echotag then they will appear only
  once.

- Fixed handling of packed *.msg style messagebases.

- Fixed invalid charset kludge in crossposted messages.

- Fixed handling of 0xe1 character in CP437 (require liblocal 0.2
  under DJGPP). (not tested, please report any problem you have with
  it)

- Fixed userlist index compilation.

! S criteria in AreaListSort now explicitly moves separator above
  the regular areas.

! Win32 console: if buffer size is set to more than 100 lines then
  windows size will be used.

- Fixed infinite loop when last message is twitkill, previous deleted
  and showdeleted is off (untested).

- Fixed header encoding in exported SOUP packets.

- Fixed small problem in editor when quoteline might left not painted
  after EDITNewLine.

- Fixed Ctrl-Down behaviour in lists.

- Fixed ignorance of index file name in @random token.

- Fixed missed expanding of environment variables in @file tokens.

- Fixed names highlighting in the header when MsgListHeader is active.

+ JAMSMAPIHIGHWATER is now active by default if "areafile fidoconfig"
  is specifyed (not tested).

- Fixed the problem with 13 hour of UTC displacement. I hope noone
  have 25 hour displacement, yep? :)

- Added forgotten https:// to the list of known URLs beginning.

- Fixed packed messagebase operation. The feature was only implemented
  for the Squish messagebase and even there scan was improperly
  implemented.

- Fixed numerical group parsing for Crashmail/CrashEcho, HPT,
  SpaceToss, QEcho and Partoss.

- Fixed reverse order sorting in 'M' criteria of AREALISTSORT (broken
  in previous snapshots).

- Fixed bug with quoting if text goes right after long kludge.

- Fixed invalid message encoding after calling externutil. There's
  still a bug left if you call externutil when kludges are shown and
  -Reload option is specifyed to externutil.

- Fixed replying on gated message to internet area.

- Fixed crash on long names in TwitName.

- Fixed net/echomail.bss updating in Hudson/GoldBase.

- Fixed reverse order sorting in 'F' criteria of AREALISTSORT (broken
  in previous snapshots).

- GoldED+ should no longer exit when system time is changed to the
  past and Timeout is non-zero. But... Timeout still calculated from
  timestamp of previous keypress.

! Some actions will not reload message if it is not required.

+ Added possibility to specify AKA in AREASEP:

  AREASEP <echoid> <"desc"> <group> <type> <aka>

! AREALISTSORT changed again. Added 'p' for personal mail presence,
  'u' for unread mail presence, and 'S' for overriding default sorting
  for criterias which are not applicable for AREASEP (F.e. try
  "PYTGSUE", "TSPYGUE", etc.).

- Fixed "EditChangeDate Always" operation.

! AREALISTSORT letters a bit changed in the way they processed:
  P - sort by personal mail count, not by the presence
  Y - sort by changing from last scan (the same criteria as used for
      '*' in AREALIST screen) with ignoring unread mail count
  Also there's a new change to the AREASEP sorting: all letters that
  could not be applied to the AREASEP (f.e. Y) are ignored during
  sorting and finally AREASEP winning if no explicit criteria found in
  the AREALISTSORT specification.

+ Added ability to READ packed messagebases. You need to add PKD
  attribute to such echo definition and specify UNPACKER for the
  extension defined. You should pack all files from the single
  messagebase to the archive with the same name. For *.msg areas you
  should add the directory as well. When entering to the archived area
  UNPACKER will be executed to unpack files to TEMPPATH. On exit, all
  files will be deleted.

  New UNPACKER keyword have the following syntax:

  UNPACKER <extension> <"commandline">

  The commandline should provide the ability to extract all files from
  @file.<extension> to the current directory. F.e.:

  UNPACKER zip "unzip @file"

  Note that all changes to the messagebase will be discarded.

  This feature is not supported for Hudson and GoldBase messagebases.

  IMPORTANT: AREADEF should contain pathname to the archive WITH
  extension!

! AREAPATH now used as default path for all SEMAPHOREs rather than
  occasionally.

! Removed keyword EditMsgSize. The message will always be loaded
  completely.

! Temporary files will be created in the TEMPPATH rather than
  GOLDPATH.

! URLHANDLER now accepts externutil options just like EXTERNUTIL (with
  the exception of utility number of course), and global EXTERNOPTIONS
  are no longer affected to the utility execution behaviour.

- Few fixes to the keyboard. Key5 should work now.

- Fixed LISTaskexit operation.

- Fixed default writetemplate.

+ Added FileToggleMarkAll to the goldkeys.cfg to invert all selected
  files on the file selection panel. Default assignment is '*'.

! Keyboard configuration token AreaShowDel renamed to ReadShowDel for
  better consistency.

+ Added set of new keywords for the language configuration file to
  make READmainmenu language-configurable:

  MI_MMMAIN             "M Main "
  MI_MMSHELL            "S Shell to OS "
  MI_MMQUIT             "Q Quit GoldED "
  MI_MMEDIT             "E Edit "

  MI_MMDIRQUOTEREPLY    "D Direct quote-reply (ignore Reply-To) "
  MI_MMCMTREPLY         "C Comment-reply                        "
  MI_MMOTHERAREA        "O Other area reply >                   "
  WT_MMOTHERAREA        " Other Area "
  MI_MMOQUOTEREPLY      "Q Quote-reply                          "
  MI_MMODIRQUOTEREPLY   "D Direct quote-reply (ignore Reply-To) "
  MI_MMOCMTREPLY        "C Comment-reply                        "
  MI_MMCHANGE           "C Change "
  MI_MMORIGIN           "O Origin    "
  MI_MMUSERNAME         "U Username  "
  MI_MMAKA              "A Aka       "
  MI_MMATTRIBUTES       "M Msg attrs "
  MI_MMTEMPLATE         "T Template  "
  MI_MMUTIL             "U Util "
  MI_MMCOPYMOVEFORWARD  "C Copy/Move/Forward     "
  MI_MMLIST             "L List messages         "
  MI_MMWRITE            "W Write to disk/printer "
  MI_MMFREQ             "F File request          "

! Help topic number associated with READmainmenu changed from 9999 to
  3019.

+ GoldED+ should now recognize AREAFILE keyword in CrashEcho config
  (not tested).

+ GoldED+ should now recognize environment variables in INCLUDE and
  area path definitions in Fidoconfig (not tested).

- Fixed small bug in goldkeys.cfg parser so the last line without
  the feed was incorrectly processed.

- Fixed pseudo in Internet areas.

- Partially fixed ATTRIBSEMAIL and ATTRIBSNEWS operation. They still
  not affected the areas defined as such through the AREAISEMAIL
  and AREAISNEWS and if no ATTRIBUTES defined in the Random System
  group. It seems will never been fixed but will rather documented as
  a feature.

! REPLYLINK defaults changed to DIRECT.

! AREAAUTOID defaults changed to LONG.

! GoldED+ will now show hidden lines and RFC header in the message
  editor. This is primarily to be able to add cc:, copy:, etc. lines
  in the Internet areas.

- Fixed old bug with ADDRESSLOOKUPFIRST when it set to the ORIGIN and
  no valid address defined in the origin.

! InternetRFCBody now could be defined to the digit, which specify the
  number of RFC headers will be tried for detection. Only usefull
  when you often receive messages multiple times gated by ifmail.

! Synchronized with recent Fidoconfig features. Removed -lame feature,
  slashes no longer parsed as escape sequencies in neither case.

+ Added peek URL feature. Goldkeys.cfg keyword: READPeekURLs, help
  topic number is 3018. The behaviour is controlled by the
  PeekURLOptions keyword: available parameters are SORT, FROMTOP,
  NOTFROMTOP. Selected URL will be processed with the commandline
  predefined with URLHANDLER (the token replaced with URL is @url).
  Language configuration:

  WT_PEEKURL         "Available URLs"
  ST_PEEKURL         "Select URL"
  IL_PEEKINFONOURLS  " No valid URLs were found in this msg! "

+ Imlemented READExternUtilMenu. You can now process message by
  entering command line. Command line executed using EXTERNOPTIONS.
  Associated help topic number is 3017. Language configuration:

  WT_EXTERNUTIL      "External utilities"
  ST_EXTERNUTIL      "Select external utility to execute"
  WT_EXECCMDLINE     "Enter command line to execute"
  MI_ENTERCMDLINE    " Enter command line "

+ Added new keyword InternetViaGate (default to no). Allows usage of
  SoupGate with AreaIsEmail. When set to yes GoldED+ will generate
  only To: line for e-mail areas, but will also encrypt message header
  in quoted printable if enabled by EncodeEmailHeaders keyword.

+ Added new keyword HighlightURLs (default to yes). Allows enable or
  disable URLs and emails highlighting.

! Removed HappyBirthday and InternetServer keywords. Anyway, they were
  useless.

- Fixed more quirks with charset.

- Fixed quotewrap in internal editor if quotestring contains a space
  inside.

! GoldED+ will no longer add new entry to addressbook if it is an
  addressmacro.

! Updated uulib to the latest version. Few bugs fixed. Unordered
  UU encode now should be processed more accurately than with original
  library.

- Fixed improper charset conversion when replying on message without
  charset between areas with different Xlatimport.

- Fixed externutils/external editor with freshly created messages.

- Fixed bug in Latin-x to ISO-8859-x converter, now charset in
  Internet mail should be properly specifyed as ISO rather than as
  Latin.

- When you change mail to the UUCP gate and InternetRFCBody is on
  GoldED+ WILL insert new To: line in the message, stripping old one.

! Completely redone Synchronet support. Should be more stable and
  adequate.

+ Added support for SpaceToss areafile. WARNING: there's no known way
  to obtain primary AKA for echo areas from tosser config ver 1.10 so
  you'll need to define them manually. Main AKA will be used by
  default. On newer versions (with UseAKA support) you should not
  expirience this problem.

- Thanks to Pavel Tsekov few more memory leaks was eliminated.

! Added "COLOR READER URL" for highlighting URLs and e-mail's.

! Message now saved by default in local codepage.

! Thread list optimized a bit by speed. It aslo should not crash on
  long threads now.

- Fixed serious bug with forwarding when ADDRESSLOOKUPFIRST set to
  MSGID (or no Origin line available) and you call either spellchecker
  or EditLoadFile function. The address was set to the address of
  original mail author.

+ Added USEAREA keyword which may be used in Random System Groups. If
  defined to NO then GoldED+ will not recognize AREA kludge.

! If USEFWD is set to NO then GoldED+ will not recognize FWD* kludges.

- You may now disable one or more stylecodes by including them in
  STYLECODESTOPS.

- Fixed hang on undo of text deletetion when text is greater than
  screen size.

- Fixed crash on calling Externutil in empty area.

- GoldED+ will now treat all unknown charsets to be equal to
  Xlatimport.

- Fixed AreaReplyDirect operation when AreaReplyTo is defined (Thanks
  to Pavel Gulchouck for the patch).

- Fixed problem with incorrect updating of timesread field when
  MSGLISTFIRST is YES.

! @pseudo creation stops at dot now as well.

- Added EditDeleteSOL action: delete text to the start of line. It
  works the same way as EditDeleteEOL in terms of what we consider to
  be a line, since it deletes to the start of the line as it seen in
  viewer, not as the line is internally represented.

- MapPath now applied to GoldPath and XlatPath.

- GoldNode now supports MapPath keyword.

- Extended conditionals in GoldNode to the same set as in GoldED.

- Fixed SHAREMODE in GoldNode.

- Fixed *.?lo file creation where the character in '?' was uppercase,
  in file requests.

! Old logo returned back with Pavel Gulchouck's patch :-)

- Fixed double WAZOO FREQ bug (Thanx to Dmitry Lebus for discovering
  problem).

! Random lines not taken from template for Changed, Write, Header and
  WriteHeader lines if not explicitly specifyed.

+ MAPPATH now affects pathes in INCLUDE and AREAFILE keywords.

- Fixed quote reflow when NLS and recoding used (Thanx, Alexey! :))

! Reverted back to old behaviour of ZapQuotesBelow.

- Fixed EDITHEADERFIRST operation.

+ Added new keyword AreaListGroupOrder to specify groups sorting order
  in arealist. The only parameter is string which specifies groups
  order (case sensitive!). If some groups are not found in the list
  they will be placed below specifyed ones in regular order.

+ Implemented FSP-0013 support. You may notice warnings about obsolete
  codepages in your config, please fix them. If you use XLATEXPORT to
  obsolete codepage and this is required on some reason you may prevent
  error by setting USECHARSET to No.

+ GoldED+ now tries to set up correct values for XLATLOCALSET,
  XLATIMPORT and XLATEXPORT basing on your locale settings.

+ Added Serg Borodin's patch for X-Comment-To recognition on SOUP
  import.

- Fixed crash on long Message ID in Internet messages.

- Fixed crash on very long name in Internet messages.

! ZapQuotesBelow now acts only on the single quotation block, not on
  the all quotes below. It's more handy, especially in case of
  removing attach from the file.

! A lot of improvements in charset handling added. QP postfix now
  could be used with any charset, not only with LATIN1. Completely
  untested!

! Changed InternetRFCBody parsing algorithm. Should be quicker.

! A lot of manipulations with Internet addressing was done.

! GoldED+ now produce Internet addresses in RFC preferable form
  "name" <email@address> instead of email@address (name).

+ Added ShowDeleted indicator to status line.

- Fixed few bugs in Undo feature.

+ Added support for AdeptXBBS for non-OS/2 systems.

+ Thanks to Alexey Froloff added support for CrashEcho tosser.

- Fixed Y2K bug in WildCat! and PCBoard bases.

  deletion any more.

+ Added new switch JamSMAPIHighwater. If defined GoldED+ will handle
  highwaters just like SMAPI do. Recommended for use with HPT.
  Defaults to No. Support for Crashmail II style highwaters added as
  well.

! Message lister redesigned. Should be quicker if you roll up and down
  but consumes more memory.

+ Added tonn of configuration keywords to goldkeys.cfg:

  Keyword                Default Assignment

  AddressbookPack        Alt-P
  AddressbookDelete      Del

  HeaderTogglePvt        Alt-P
  HeaderToggleSent       Alt-S

! READuserbase renamed to READaddressbook.

! Changed default values for the following keywords:

  Keyword        New Default    Old Default

  ASKDELORIG     NO             YES
  STYLECODES     YES            HIDE
  QUOTEWRAPHARD  NO             YES

- Fixed leading space macroses in date/time format strings.

- Fixed double recoding of header during forward, quote-reply, and
  change.

+ Added new keyword WRITETEMPLATE which defines template to be used on
  saving messages. Could be used in Random System Groups or globally.

+ You can explicitly select built-in template by defining "built-in".

! Fixed filelocking in UNIX version.

- Fixed "Via" kludge handling in JAM areas.

! Quote wrapping algorithm slightly changed.

- Fixed some quirks in internal editor.

- Fixed EDITHARDLINE keyword operation.

- Fixed QUOTEWRAPHARD keyword operation.

! Freed lot of stack on displaying message header. Please report
  (cosmetic?) bugs if any.

- Fixed small bug in parser.

+ Added new keyword INTERNETGATEEXP to configure expansion of UUCP
  gated e-mail into To: line:

  INTERNETGATEEXP Address       // To: bob@fisher.com
  INTERNETGATEEXP Address, Name // To: bob@fisher.com (Bob Fisher)
  INTERNETGATEEXP Name, Address // To: "Bob Fisher" <bob@fisher.com>

  Other combinations treated as "Address, Name". Default assignment
  "Name, Address".

- Addressbook now more accurate with e-mail addresses in FTN areas,
  it no longer update FTN address with Internetgate (define it in
  the group if it is different from default) and put Internet address
  in corresponding field.

- Template keyword now properly extracts filename within random system
  groups.

! @*addr macroses now expanded by default without domain, if you ever
  need 5d addresses use @*addr{domain} scheme.

- Fixed @ofrom, @oto recoding.

! Header of message saved from Golded now defined in template, default
  assignment (for built-in template, not for yours):

  @header= @oecho (@caddr) @align{79}{=}
  @header Msg  : @msgno of @msgs@align{44}@attr
  @header From : @_oname @_oaddr @odtime
  @header To   : @dname
  @header Subj : @subject
  @header@align{79}{=}

  String beyond @header used when you asked for a header. You may also
  use @write as prefix to store something special if you asked for a
  message body (with or without header), though have no idea when
  @write may be useful except of changing first line of template to:

  @write= @oecho (@caddr) @align{79}{=}

+ Added new macroses:

  @msgno            current message number in messagebase
  @msgs             number of messages in current messagebase
  @attr             attribute string
  @align{pos}{char} align to `pos' with `char'
  @cfrom            same as @ofrom but for current message
  @cto              same as @oto but for current message
  @odtime           expanded according to MS_DateTimeFmt for original
                    message time
  @cdtime           current time in MS_DateTimeFmt format
  @fpgp             either e-mail or name from "From" field
  @dpgp             either e-mail or name from "To" field
  @osver            operation system version

- Fixed bug in expanding fixed lenght macroses.

- Removed useless macroses: @serialno, @os2slash.

+ Search speed significantly improved in Win32 version.

! Window size in Win32 version now calculated from different
  parameters, you may need to adjust screen properties before running
  GoldED+ (especially in Win2k with it's defaults 300 rows :)). Though
  most users shouldn't noticed this change.

+ Status line update speed improved.

- Fixed character stripping on the clipboard block boundary.

! Default value for DispTabSize changed to 8.

! If @pseudo token created from address it now stops not only on space
  but at @ as well, so no more "Hello bigfoot@shoes.com!" :-)

! Maximum number of commands that could be assigned to single macro
  extended upto 127 commands.

- ViewQuote operation fixed for locales different from ASCII.

- @cdate and @ctime now should be correct for changed messages.

! PGP encoded/signed messages now detected by substring

  "-----BEGIN PGP "

  in first line of message rather than

  "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----"

- Fixed keyboard handling in Win9x/ME (not well tested).

- Control characters (except tab, CR and LF) no longer stripped at the
  end of line.

+ If there's Reply-To: line in the beginning of message then it
  processed internally like REPLYADDR kludge with higher priority.

- Fixed EditMacro command to be able to execute commands which
  operates on selected block.

- Fixed expansion of environment variables in GoldNode and for
  includes and areafile definition.

+ Added new keyword QUOTESTOPS. If one of characters defined by this
  keyword found before quotechar then line will be not treated as
  quote. Defaults to "<\"'-", may be used as global keyword or in
  random system groups.

- Fixed page wrapping in help window.

- Added some improvements for better charset handling.

- Fixed decoding of MIME-encoded From and To fields.

- Fixed block keyboard mode under Win9x/ME.

- Fixed crash if GoldED+ was unable to open Crashmail II config.

+ If filenames specified without path and File Attach attribute is set
  Attachpath automatically prepended to every filename.

- Fixed date in attach selection menu.

- If directory typed in subject field without slash at the end files
  from proper directory selected instead of GOLDEDPATH.

- Fixed attached file size display if path starts from slash.

- Support for old Fastechoes reverted back.

- Area Catch-up and Scan now disabled if there's active area. This
  should improve stability.

! Returned NETNAME keyword in another incarnation:

   * Origin: bla-bla-bla (2:5020/604.19@fidonet)

  This style doesn't break any of FTS or FSC. Domain from Address or
  AKA keywords override Netname keyword if specific address used.
  This keyword could be used in random system groups.

+ Added READDirQuoteMsg and READMoveDirQuoteMsg entries for
  goldkeys.cfg: quote message ignoring Reply-To kludge (in current and
  another area correspondingly). Both added to READMainmenu menu.
  There's no default keyboard assignment.

- Fixed READMainmenu operation.

- Fixed incorrect filenames displaying in /w32 version.

- Fixed crash of Win32 version when output/input redirected to/from
  file.

- Fixed case sensivity in macro expansion.

- Fixed insertion of extra space before Origin line if entry is taken
  from file.

______________________________________________________________________

               Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.4.7, December 02 2000
______________________________________________________________________

- It is now possible to use filepicker if there's very long filenames.

- Fixed filelist parser for national languages.

+ It is now possible to edit Group field in addressbook even though
  there's no sence for this :-)

- Added workaround for inserting of random line into message.

- Fixed incorrect help category display after EDITHeader.

! Removed unused help entries from READMainmenu.

- Fixed memory overrun in file attach creation.

- Fixed insertion of extra spaces around Origin line if entry is taken
  from file.

+ Logged version name now combined with release date (for easy sorting
  out the logs received).

- It was impossible to change To: field when replying to the Internet
  gated message when lookup turned off. Fixed.

+ Via, Recd and Forwarded kludges now displayed in the bottom of
  message in JAM areas.

- Cut-n-paste Unicode clipboard under Windows NT now properly filled
  with Unicode version of control characters with the exception of CR,
  LF, tabulation. It's fun to copy kludges from GoldED+ to WordPad ;-)

- Fixed lockout/crash on errorneous exit.

- Now if there is no address defined GoldED+ will exit with error at
  startup rather than crashes later.

! Low-level screen handling routines rearranged. New implementation of
  Win32 code included. This code should work well with Win2k raster
  fonts without registry patching.

- Fixed incorrect timeslicing in DPMI32 version.

- BADAREA and DUPEAREA now "local"s rather then "echo"s for
  fidoconfig.

! Changed keyboard handling under Win32, Win9x code seems to work
  better. Shift-Tab no longer require additional keypress of Tab.

+ Address typed in name field now searched in addressbook as well.

- Cosmetic fix: MI_CHARSETAUTO now defaults to " Auto " (i.e. with two
  spaces around).

! Being annoyed by users who dislike read notework, added COLOR READER
  QUOTE1. COLOR READER QUOTE now set color for QUOTE1 and QUOTE2 as in
  old good times. If QUOTE appears before QUOTE2 you may change
  nothing in your config.

- Fixed some bugs in undo feature.

- Fixed empty message creation (used in attach, filerequest, etc.)

! Message header now translated with default rules in most cases. If
  there's something wrong with it (f.e. double decoding or no decoding
  at all) please report. Also, original message header should be
  handled more carefully now.

+ Asciitilde now recognized more properly, so even ~anotheruser/file
  should work. Also environment variables defined as %TEMP%/file
  should be expanded in more cases. Feel free to report bug if
  something doesn't work.

- @CC kludges now created at top of message rather than in place
  where CC: found (this feature was also silently introduced in
  1.1.4.5 binaries for some platforms).

! Added historical section to this file regarding to 3.0.1-asa8 and
  -asa4 releases. No more history left, only guesses...

- Fixed Bug #109368: Ged+ crashes if there are more than 30 links in
  the help. Now accepts up to 50, and ignores more.

- Fixed bug that made GoldED+ not behave well with daylight savings
  time (it showed an hour less).

              Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.4.6, September 19 2000
______________________________________________________________________

+ GoldEd+ now recognizes the asciitilde (~) alias for the home
  directory, in Linux.

- Fixed small bug in console shiftstate code under Linux.

+ Filenames in file requests are not converted to uppercase in Linux
  any more.

+ Now it is possible to exclude config file formats and messagebase
  formats from GoldEd+ at compile-time.

- Fixed the message-forward feature.

- Fixed a bug in message quoting if QUOTEWRPHARD == YES

+ You can now read the output of a command instead of a file, using
  the syntax |command as the input filename.

               Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.4.5, June 18 2000
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed some memory leaks regarding to GROUP feature, REPLYADDR
  parsing, undo.

- Fixed small bug in fidoconfig parser that brokes correct handling of
  INCLUDE keyword.

- Adjusted buffer size in Crashmail II parser, added LOCALAREA
  recognition.

- EditExportText now saves whole the message to file, this is more
  predictable behaviour than before.

- Fixed incorrect lines chain after insertion from file/clipboard.

- Function that builds full pathname bit adjusted for non-UNIX
  systems. This should lead to better results there.

- Fixed wrong character display in editor mode when line empty.

- Filed incorrect cutting of line portion.

- Fixed FREQ feature.

- Fixed addressbook, nodelist browser when in edit header mode.

- Fixed small cosmetic bug in nodelist window regarding to filepath.

- Bit rearranged code that encodes RFC headers for latin-xx codepages.
  Now GoldED+ automatically generates proper iso-8859-xx charset.
  Please response if it doesn't work.

+ Added dirty hack for Linux console users, so now CUI interface more
  functional there.

- Fixed broken MAPPATH / MAPDRIVE keywords.

              Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.4.4, April 25 2000
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed sound support under DOS (GSNDAPI).

- From the previous version GoldED+ does not read goldrand.cfg
  separately. Just include it with INCLUDE if not yet ;-)

- Fixed some memory leaks.

- Fixed small bug regarding cursor position after deleting stuff
  in input fields.

- Fixed crash after saving message to text file.

- Fixed incorrect Editcompletion behaviour in overwrite mode.

- Fixed incorrect "this message is not from you" message appearance
  in netmail areas.

             Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.4.3, February 21 2000
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed incorrect timestamps on messages.

+ Implemented full access to Synchronet bases. Deleting implemented by
  setting DEL attribute to the message.

- Fixed bugs in origin and tagline selection menus.

! A lot of GoldED+ internals was rearranged once again.

- Fixed one more mistyping in TOPT/FMPT kludge fix.

! Maximus 2.x is obsolete by Y2K, removed.

- Fixed small bug in CC: processing.

- Fixed small cosmetic bug in hexdump.

______________________________________________________________________

             Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.4.2, February 10 2000
______________________________________________________________________

! Alexander's charset patch replaced with the similar patch which
  uses different mechanism: now if charset manually selected then
  IgnoreCharset option automatically became active. To disable option
  state you need to select "Auto" charset.

+ Added new .lng file keyword MI_CHARSETAUTO, defaults to "Auto".

! SWAPPATH removed since it useless.

! GoldED+ no longer uses most of binary configuration files. The
  required files are: goldhelp.ge?, goldrand.ge?, and goldxlat.ge?.
  Some of them probably will be removed soon too.

! Added Synchronet message base support in read-only mode. Could be
  defined in configuration files by using SMB (AreaDef) and Y (Area)
  identifiers:

  AREADEF SYNCHRO.TEST "" 0 Local SMB e:\ged\smb\smb\msgbase . (R/O)

  Please do not try to delete messages or reply in SMB areas, this not
  implemented yet so the result is unpredictable.

- Fixed partially implemented TOPT/FMPT kludges appearance after
  copying/moving from squish message bases.

- Right side slashes now used again when calling externutils.

______________________________________________________________________

             Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.4.1, January 31 2000
______________________________________________________________________

- GoldED+ now correctly recognizes RFC-style Date kludge which
  contains 4 digits year field (not 2 digits as described in RFC-822).

- When moving/copying messages from squish netmail to non-squish
  netmail TOPT and FMPT kludges now added if required.

- Fixed date handling in Hudson and GoldBase message bases.

! The following keywords was renamed due to an internal collision:

  WT_HEADEREDITHELP1  WT_HEADEREDITHELP_1
  WT_HEADEREDITHELP2  WT_HEADEREDITHELP_2

- Fixed broken sound support in GoldED+/386.

- Fixed set of bugs in fidoconfig parser (broken since moved to STL).

- Fixed missed %E token in time format.

- Fixed broken @cdate, @ctime macroses.

- Added option "lame" to fidoconfig parser. This disables expansion of
  backslashes as escape-sequences:

  Areafile fidoconfig -lame m:\y\lame\fidoconfig\is\here

+ Added keyword BeepFactor, the default value is 1000. This used as
  multiplier to sound lenght.

- One more reason why GoldED+ could crashes at startup fixed.

+ It is now possible to remove ftn address from the addressbook by
  cleaning field, not by entering address 0: :-)

- Wrapped RFC kludges now properly processed too.

! Casted voodoo spell on STL =%-) Probably GoldED+ stands bit stable
  now.

- Fixed truncation of clipboard name on slashes.

+ Integrated patches by Alexander Tsvyashchenko:

  Added new keyword SHOWDELETED to set status of "soft"-deleted
  messages in Jam bases. Could be switched on the fly by AreaShowDel
  (default assignment to Alt-F8) in golded.cfg.

  Added "magic" charset Auto. Now if user have choose translation
  table manually (by Ctrl-J) GoldED+ will use selected page for
  translation regardless of the CHRS and CHARSET kludge. If Auto
  charset selected then GoldED+ will look at the CHARSET kludges
  first. Please, add something like this to your config if you use
  XLAT feature and want to use Auto feature:

  XLATCHARSET AUTO CP866 rus_rus.chs

                      Happy Old New Year! :-)
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed bug in environment variable extension (introduced in 1.1.3).

+ GermanKeyboard now also active by default for Polish locale.

+ Added new template keyword @widepid which is expanded to X-Mailer
  like string.

- Fixed small unsignificant bug in installation procedure which causes
  leaving zero-sized config if install was terminated.

- Fixed memory leak in geline.cpp.

+ Removed poor stack limitation in DPMI version.

- Fixed set of small bugs in internal editor (especially in undo
  feature). EDITUNDELETE now has same functionality as before GoldED+
  1.1.2 been released.

- Fixed two bugs which cause misterious crash in some circumstances
  on startup.

+ If TaskTitle defined to empty string then GoldED+/386 will not
  change virtual machine name.

+ Added %C in date macroses (short for "%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y"). If
  strftime from RTL of compiler used for build your version of GoldED+
  supports undescribed in manual macroses you may use them also but
  remember that language support via GoldED+ internals provided only
  for %a, %A, %b, %B, and %C.

! Warning: a lot of code was rearranged once again. This may cause
  new bugs but it simplifies further development.

- Fixed some date-parsing problems.

+ Thanks to Jacobo Tarrio GoldED+ now have priliminary ncurses support
  under Linux. It is probably will be easier to port (or even just
  compile :)) GoldED+ to other x86 UNIX like OS'es.

- Fixed bug which breaks creation of "To: bla-bla-bla" line using
  information taken from addressbook in messages to be gated.

+ If page from GoldHelp.cfg (the data between two *P identifyers) not
  fit to single screen it now will be splitted on the window boundary
  automatically.

+ Tabulations in inserted text now properly replaced. Please note that
  expanded lines should not exceed 2Kb boundary (I hope that's ok for
  most users).

- Repaired "Color Reader Hidden" keyword. If something still painted
  in the regular kludge color please report.

+ Added new option to "Write to" menu and new keyword for goldlng.cfg
  file associated with this option:

    MI_WRITETOHDRONLY       "H Use Header: ONLY "

  Now you may write only header to file/printer/clipboard if required.

- Fixed nodelist index creation in GoldNode if one or more nodelist is
  missed.

            Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.3.2, December 18 1999
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed bug in dir handler under Linux.

- UNDO now bit properly restore screen after undone of "zap quotes
  below" and importing file.

- Fixed small bug in ZapQuotesBelow.

! Hudson/Goldbase code was merged in single template. Please report
  any new problem immediately. (For source code users: there is
  probably no more chance to compile this code with anything except
  GNU C)

! Removed support for FastEcho < 1.42 (anyway all of them is not Y2K
  compliant).

- Fixed serious bug appeared somewhere in latest -asa's or first
  GED+'s: if Areareplyto was defined to unexisted area or there was
  problems with the first area definition then GoldED+ crashed while
  saving echomail messages.

- Probably completely fixed bug in handling netmail.

- Fixed small bug in directory handling class.

- Fixed bug in REPLYADDR/REPLYTO handling.

- Fixed bug in ADDRESSMACRO keyword handling.

- Fixed GoldNode timestamp checking.

- Fixed small bug in InternetRFCBody processing (untested).

- Fixed incorrect time of files in attach window (only Win32 version
  was affected).

+ Added support for Crashmail II areafile:
  Areafile Crashmail c:\where\is\config.ext

______________________________________________________________________

             Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.3, November 27 1999
______________________________________________________________________

+ A lot of memory leaks removed from window library.

! RDDT ported to STL.

+ Fidoconfig parser now could recognize Jam option.

+ GoldNode now could compile as many nodelists/userlists as you want
  and made bit faster.

+ AREACOPYDIRECT no longer influence on forwarding. If you like old
  behaviour there is new keyword AREAFORWARDDIRECT for you which could
  be defined to Yes or No and used in Random System Group as well as
  AREACOPYDIRECT.

- CROSSPOST now defaults to Ask as promised before ;-)

- Fixed creation of broken @CC kludge.

! MS_LISTCC now defaults to "%s  %s", ST_STATUSCC - "CC: %s of %s".
  Please adjust it in your goldlang.cfg if you use it.

! WARNING: Some basic internal classes (filebrowser, *.msg scanning
  code, string class, crossposting, carbon copying, addressbook) was
  redesigned or significantly changed.

- Minor fixes in editor.

! SoftCR now replaced in right place ;-) I mean it is replaced on
  saving message to base, not at the moment of entering message. So
  probably spellcheckers could be used more safely. Also this fixes
  problem with replacing SoftCR under Linux. SoftCR not translated
  in Subject field of Attach, Freq and UReq messages which looks to
  be ok. SoftCRs now properly used in Squish message base with
  DispSoftCR turned on (they was stripped at the beginning of new
  line regardless of this keyword option). If EditHardTerm turned OFF
  but DispSoftCR turned ON SoftCRs no longer produced in Ezycom bases.
  This may broke something but I don't see any reason why this should
  fail. I should also note that this feature is works ONLY in
  combination with DispSoftCr Yes. Russian users may copy following
  two lines to forget about SoftCR-problem completely:
  -- cut here --
  DispSoftCr     Yes
  EditSoftCrXlat H
  -- cut here --

______________________________________________________________________

             Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.2, November 04 1999
______________________________________________________________________

+ GoldED+ now have undo in internal editor. *BIG* thanx to Denis
  Zavorotny (2:467/28) who implement it. Default assignment to
  Alt-Backspace:

  @Backspace EditUndo

  NB! As undo stack is currently unlimited, to avoid unpredictable
  behaviour when the top of stack reaches an item with freed line, the
  kill-buffer (Ctrl-Y) was made unlimited also (i.e. EDITUNDELETE has
  no effect in this version).

- Fixed bug with incorrect handling of USER.BBS file.

- #Del now supported in goldkeys.cfg under DOS, Win32, and OS2.

- Added new keyword CROSSPOST to configure query appearence before
  crosspossting, defaults to Ask. Possible values: Yes, No, and Ask.

- Added LOCALAREA support to fidoconfig parser.

- Canceling nodelist browser while lookup carbon copies to unexisted
  address no loner produce letters to your address.

______________________________________________________________________

            Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.1.2, September 20 1999

- Fixed 'unfreed memory' error message appearence (broken in 1.1.1.1).

______________________________________________________________________

            Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.1.1, September 08 1999
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed pasting from clipboard broken since 1.1.1.

- Squish config parser once again uses -$ at the beginning as
  identifier of squish format for echo. This behaviour confirmed by
  Scott Dudley so Partoss users should use -f flag at the end if they
  uses groups (-$g) or descriptions (-$n) for Fido-style bases.

- I forgot to mention that there are new goldlang keyword added:

   MS_CCTO "* Carbon copied to %s"

  Thanks to Andrew again :-)

______________________________________________________________________

               Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.1, August 16 1999
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed triming of spaces when pasting from clipboard.

- Probably fixed appearence of AREA: kludge on crossposting / carbon
  copying when AreaYouWroteTo used.

- Fixed memory overrun in CHS table reader.

! Added three new tokens that could be invalidated: cc, xc, xp. This
  lines only invalidated when message forwarded or text inserted via
  EDITRead menu.

- Probably fixed memory overrun that appeared while invalidating.

- Fixed incorrect cc: processing in Names mode ("CC: " was missed in
  first line).

- Fixed bug in USERNAME parser.

- Fixed bug in crosspost hiding.

- Fixed bug with missed headers in written messages.

______________________________________________________________________

                Notes for GoldED+ 1.0.0, July 15 1999
______________________________________________________________________

- Actually print device should be left open so I just broke printing,
  sorry :(

+ Added powerful uu/xx/mime/binhex multi-messages decoder using uulib
  from well-known uudeview by Frank Pilhofer. Please note that it
  writes all selected messages to disk before decoding so selecting
  whole base simultaneously is not a good idea ;-)

+ Fixed bug rarely appeared while uudecoding messages (caused by long
  filepathes).

- Fixed quoting that was broken in 1.1.0 version.

+ Added new keywords to Goldkeys.cfg: EditCopy, EditCut, EditDelete,
  EditPaste, EditBlockPgUp, EditBlockPgDn, EditBlockHome,
  EditBlockEnd, EditBlockUp, EditBlockDown, EditBlockLeft,
  EditBlockRight.

+ Added keyword AreaCFMReplyTo to send CFM messages to particular
  area.

______________________________________________________________________

                Notes for GoldED+ 1.1.0, July 07 1999
______________________________________________________________________

+ Added new keyword GermanKeyboard <yes/no>, defaults to autodetect.
  Processed only by Win32 version, ignored by others. When active
  right Alt key will be processed as AltGr, otherwise it will have
  same functionality as left Alt. This keyword replaces command-line
  switch -R.

! Removed support for Netname keyword since it breaks our primary FTS
  standarts.

- Kludge ROUTE actually looks like #ROUTE. Fixed.

+ Fixed crossposting to 5D FTN addresses.

- Fixed destruction of various long wrapped kludges (mostly relies to
  Internet kludges). Please report if there's something new broken ;-)

- Fixed fix intended for long kludges wrapping problem resolving.

+ Added new keyword FormFeedSeparator. Switched off by default, when
  enabled inserts Form Feed (0x0c) character between messages while
  saving to file.

- Fix bug which causes printer device left open after printing.

+ It is now possible to write multiple messages to clipboard.

- @d*name, @dpseudo tokens now accept third parameter to specify
  "all" name, this feature replaces previously announced feature with
  automatic conversion Whoto to lowercase.

- Fixed stupid bug in sqafix config parser which broke it completely.

- Slightly changed keyboard behaviour in DOS and OS/2 versions: if
  NUMLOCK is active then numpad keys pressed together with shift-keys
  treated just like grey keys (without shifts). Now it is common
  behaviour for OS/2, DOS and Win32 versions. Linux version only
  missed... Till 1.0.2 hopefully ;-)

- Fixed entering of russian letter 'p' (0xe0) in OS/2 version on
  extended keyboards, and entering of dot from numpad in Win95.

! Changed name of product to GoldED+, naming convention for archives
  now: gpPABCCC.ext, where gp stands for GoldED Plus, P - platform ID
  (x - DOS32, w - Win32, o - OS/2, l - Linux, s - sources, and
  m - manual), A - major version, B - middle version (odd for stable,
  even for unstable), CCC - minor version.

- Fix in Squish config parser: according to documentation -$mXXX
  implicitly turns on -$ switch.

- Fixed endless loop when answering on message with Area kludge
  pointed to current area.

______________________________________________________________________

! Due to limitations of Windows 9x Title in /386 version works only if
  GoldEd runned from DOS console application and not from within Win32
  console application. Bit improved.

+ Some new language configuration keywords added:

   MS_ORIGINALLYIN      "* Originally in %s"
   WT_CROSSPOST         " Crosspost "
   MI_XCPROCESS         "P Process XC's "

   MI_XCLISTLINE        "L Line       "
   MI_XCLISTREMOVE      "R Remove     "
   WT_ADDRESSBOOK       " Addressbook "
   WT_ADVANCEDSEARCH    " Advanced Search "
   IL_NOMOREMATCHES     " No more matches found "
   WT_HEADEREDITHELP1   " #F10: Nodelist "
   WT_HEADEREDITHELP2   " F10: Addressbook "
   WT_THREADLISTTITLE   " Message Thread List "
   WT_ADVANCEDMARKING   " Advanced Marking "
   ST_USERSTATUSLINE    "GoldED's Address Book - %d of %d (%d left)"
   WT_USERHEADERNAME    "Name"
   WT_USERHEADERORG     "Organization"
   WT_USERHEADERAKA     "Address"
   IL_USERWAIT          " Wait - Browsing Address Book... "

+ It is possible to make carbon copies directly from echo to
  AreaReplyTo area if this area is netmail.

- Added experimental support for QEcho by Eugene Sorochinsky (with JAM
  messagebases) AreaList file. Specifying primary address by number is
  not supported. If location is not specified then GoldEd takes
  default value /etc/qecho/AreaList (untested).
  AREAFILE qecho /etc/qecho-jam/AreaList

+ Added support for DZ echolist format:
  AREAFILE echolist echo5020.lst -dz

- Fixed small bug in sqafix arealist parser.

- Fixed buggy feature of squish parser that forces area to squish
  format as long as it parses -$ at the beginning of switch (now exact
  token -$ should be present).

- If typing over selected block in internal editor selected text will
  be killed.

- Locale now supported in djgpp and emx verions. Please note, that
  to use locale in DOS you should have COUNTRY properly configured in
  config.sys.

! Removed support for GIF kludge.

- Fixed output of attribute window if it out of screen bounds.

- Removed fix of output in non-standart screen modes ;-)

- Fix origin line in carbon copies.

! If first lines in message begins with From: or To: such lines will
  be parsed like an internet address.

- A lot of fixes / features related to carbon copies creation: it is
  possibe now to use addressbook and addressmacro (subject and
  attributes not changed though) with it, if replying on internet
  originated message it is possible now to override address, To: lines
  in carbon copies used only when appropriate, it is now possible to
  specify full name of addresse in internet carbon-copies (for
  example, cc: "Alexander S. Aganichev" <asa@eed.miee.ru>).

______________________________________________________________________

               Notes for 3.0.1-asa10 beta2, June 21 1999
______________________________________________________________________

- Fix problem with hiding stylecodes after hexdump viewing.

- Fix problem painting stylecodes while editing.

- Fix incorrect behaviour of RcvDisablesCfm in some cases.

- Fix EditChangeDate Always behaviour.

- Fix/cleanup D'Bridge, EzyCom, FMail 0.98, GEcho prior to 1.20,
  IMail, InterMail, LoraBBS, Maximus 3.xx, Opus, PCBoard, ProBoard,
  Portal of Power, QuickBBS, QFront, QWK, RemoteAccess, RA-Echo,
  SuperBBS, TosScan, WMail, XMail, and XBBS config parsers.

- Fixed output in non-standart screen modes (i.e. in 72x25: GoldEd
  sometimes outputs characters out of screen range).

+ Added support for ANSIPLUS clipboard under DOS (untested).

+ Added Title support in /386 version under Win9x.

+ Golded now will prompt before crossposting.

! Invalidation of tearline, origins, and seen-by's also done at
  savetime. Please note that if you don't like quotation of tearline
  and/or origin you should use QUOTECTRL keyword and not INVALIDATE
  keyword.

- Kludge ROUTE added to default list of known kludges.

! Keyword IFMAILGATES replaced with ADDRESSLOOKUPFIRST with possible
  values MSGID and Origin.

+ Added keyword QUOTECTRL with possible list of values Yes, No,
  Tearline, and Origin. Default Yes. This keyword could be used in
  random system groups.

                    (Happy Birthday, Lubashka! ;-))
______________________________________________________________________

+ Added keyword RcvDisablesCfm (default yes) that controls checking of
  Cfm and RRq flags on mail with Rcv one.

- Fix Fileattach-problem in Linux-version (filenames got uppercased)

+ GoldED now produces a more standard-conforming and informative
  X-Mailer string, like i.e. "GoldED 3.0.1-dam3 (Linux 2.2.9 i586)".
  The information is (of course) calculated at runtime rather at
  compile time.

! A '%' in the domainpart of the Message-ID (internet part) caused some
  braindead spamfilters to activate. Therefore it is now again replaced
  by a dot, as ever before. Note that you can configure the domain-part
  by using INTERNETDOMAIN!
  Most users won't care about it, however.

! X-Mailer seems to be more often used than X-Mailreader. So GoldED now
  also sets X-Mailer instead of the second one.

- Don't automatically add new entries to the addressbook if
   - name is an email address
   - address is a MAILINGLIST sender address

! Made the "Organization" coloumn a little bit smaller, so
  address coloum is larger (useful for inet-style addresses)

! Fidoconfig now parsed more properly and even properly than with
  original library by Matthias Tichy. I don't think that someone
  should continue using fidoconfig library due to a lot of bugs and
  incompletions in it. On some unexplainable reasons comments in
  fidoconfig stripped from the back, so following line broke parser:

  Sysop Test line # with bug # and " features

  The only supported version is 0.15 since Matthias ignore my question
  about backward compatibility of configuration files.

______________________________________________________________________

+ Multimedia now supported in Mingw32 version (requires dirty hacks in
  standart headers. If you don't like hacks you could disable support
  in gall/gsnd.cpp and wait for a new version of headers.

+ Timestamps in Mingw32 version now compatible with other versions.
  Old timestamps now used again.

+ Locale now used where available, so at least Win32 version will
  properly handle case conversion.

+ IfmailGates (yes/[no]) - do not use address from Origin.

+ TaskTitle "string" - window title (Win32 and OS/2 only).

+ TitleStatus ([yes]/no) - adds brief description to title.

+ GedHandshake ([yes]/no) - hides handshake in statusline.

+ UseTZUTC (yes/[no]) - activates TZUTC kludge. (NB! This keyword
  makes TimeZoneOffset obsolete. You should also set up timezone.
  Probably you should add TZ variable to your environment. At my
  system (Moscow, Russia) it setted up to:

  TZ=MSK-3MSD,M3.5.0/02:00,M10.5.0/03:00

+ AreaYouWroteTo now could be used in random groups.

+ Subjects now autoconverted from mime encoding.

+ Golded now uses system clipboard in internal editor.

+ If clipboard not provided by OS or not supported (DOS, OS/2 without
  PM, UNIX'es) GoldEd use fake clipboard, so you still able to copy
  mail from area to buffer and then insert it in your message.

+ Fixed crashes on viewing some messages and hexdump appeared since
  -asa8 release.

+ Fixed insertion of lines sized 79-80 chars without <CR> from
  clipboard that was broken in early -asa.

+ Fixed painting of wrapped kludges.

+ Fixed wrapping of quotes that was broken in early -asa.

- Removed obsolete keywords: AREAAUTOFREQ, AREABADMSGS, AREASORT,

  USEBIOS, and XPLIST.

+ SqaFix configuration parser added:

  AreaFile EchoList -sqafix c:\fido\mail\squish\sqafix.cfg

+ It is possible now to use Shift-... with clipboard.

+ Added @Moderator template token that enables line only if substring
  "moderator" found in the "From" line.

+ Improved handling of @_token's and extend tokens with @*pseudo
  (lookup addressbook), @f* (current from), @*3daddr (boss address).

+ Incorporated Pavel Gulchouck's stream clipboard patch.

+ New command-line switch -R: right Alt key will work same as left.

- Fixed a bug with stripping block of lines after long kludge.

- Fixed stylecodes support for origin line.

- Fixed national language word left, word right movement.

- Areas.BBS parser now properly handles echos with exclamation mark.

- Fixed ImportEnd flow while importing file without CR at end and
  option EDITHardTerm set to NO.

______________________________________________________________________

- Now UsePID actually works. It was a bad idea to save two bytes on
  brackets ;)

- Major fix to strlwr, strupr appeared in many places in DJGPP version
  introduced in -asa7

- Fixed clipboard handling in DJGPP version

+ Next experiment on stylecodes.

- Fixed problem with long ImportBegin and ImportEnd lines by cutting
  to display margin.

+ Global Macro now supported while in edit mail header mode.

- Fixed bug with missed sound support in DJGPP version

+ Proper charset ID now used in encoded e-mail headers

- Fixed serious bug in Windows clipboard handling in Win32 version
  introdused in -asa6

+ Incorporated patches by Igor Vanin:

  ExternUtils did not work if compiled using Watcom C++ 10.0b for OS/2
  because of using spawnvpe() RTL-call instead of system(). Fixed.

  Added new keywords into configuration file:

  USEPID <yes/no>  (default = yes)
  If disabled, the PID kludge is not inserted in messages (for those,
  who does not like many kludges in messages).

  USECHARSET <yes/no>  (default = yes)
  If disabled, the CHRS kludge is not inserted in messages (for those,
  who does not like many kludges in messages).

  Added/fixed system clipboard support in OS/2 version.
  Menu commands: Import -> From clipboard, Write to -> Clipboard.

  Function gposixdir::open did not work because of backslash at the
  end of path (compiler WC/2 10.0b). Fixed (as in 3.0.0).

  There were problems with cursor size in non-standard _fullscreen_
  video modes (for example, 80x30) in OS/2 version. Fixed.

- GoldEd no longer lookups pseudonyms in addressbook if not required.

- Fixed DJGPP compiled version output interface to work properly under
  Windows NT. I don't know if it properly works under DESQView now.

- Fixed small bug with importing unterminated long lines.

- Little fix to stylecode-detection to skip marking of c:* c:\*.*,
  also could be done by STYLECODESTOPS/STYLECODEPUNCT in config.

- Bugfix in @*pseudo handling. I've stupidly copied portion of code...
  Sorry to all ;(

- Bugfix in origin detection.

______________________________________________________________________

                 Notes for 3.0.1-asa4, February 21 1999
                    (binary release DOS/386g, Win32)
______________________________________________________________________

+ FSC-0032 compliant quote-check, except for space after '>'. Bound
  is set to 10 chars.

+ New stylecode-detection algorithm. /usr/sbin/ftpd and *.* no longer
  will be marked. Please report any problems to <asa@eed.miee.ru> or
  2:5020/604.19

+ READaddressbookadd now checks for the marked messages.

+ CROSSPOSTLIST now could be defined to YES to produse more compact
  lines. Also there are little fix to missed name of current echo in
  lists. You still be able to hide it's name if put # in front of it
  in first line with xc:

- Repaired STYLECODES keyword (gccfgg0.cpp, gdefs.h, gutlmisc.cpp).
  Valid options are YES (show and mark), NO (show and do not mark),
  HIDE (strip and mark).

+ New macroses (gemsgs.cpp):

  @faddr      Current address.
  @ffname     Current first name.
  @flname     Current last name.
  @fname      Current name.
  @_faddr     Current address (fixed width: 19 chars).
  @_fname     Current name (fixed width: 34 chars).

  @f* is differ from @c* in that fact, that it's actual "From:"

  @?pseudo    pseudonym (see addressbook), or @?fname, where ? is one
              of the "dotfc".

+ DJGPP version now support long filenames (if provided by OS), you
  could disable it by setting environment variable LFN to N.

- small bug in USERNAME, which added an invalid aka if there was
  a comma in the parameter.

! Because of the linux paths which may start with a "/", AREAFILE
  options parser has changed. Previously, it inofficially accepted a
  slash as a starting charactor for an option (note this wasn't
  documented!). Now, options may only start by an "-". Please adjust
  your config, if you used such undocumented behaviour!

  Example:

  Change

    AREAFILE Imail c:\im /NoChk

  to

    AREAFILE Imail c:\im -NoChk.

- @origin, @tearline and @tagline tokens weren't replaced by random
  lines when using them in a template file. Fixed.

______________________________________________________________________

                   Notes for 3.0.1, February 7 1999
                       (binary version release)
______________________________________________________________________

+ GoldNODE can now handle IF/ELSE/ENDIF conditional and INCLUDE
  directives in configuration file.

+ Extended syntax of the following template tokens:
  @oname, @ofname, @olname, @dname, @dfname, @dlname. You can now
  add up to two replacement tokens according to the following sheme:

    @oname{I}{You} wrote a mail to @dname{me}{you}:

  GoldED will select the right replacement strings. You can specify
  empty braces, like @oname{}{You} or @oname{I}{} (shorter, but
  equivalent variant is @oname{I}). Note that the new syntax is of
  course optional, you can use @oname like before and don't care
  about this new feature.

+ Added READaddressbookadd, defaults to Ctrl-B. When using this key,
  GoldED will add the current writer of the mail to the addressbook,
  unless it's already known to it.

+ Added packing of Addressbook. Default key-assignment (which cannot
  be changed at the moment) is ALT-P. When you call that function,
  GoldED will remove all "soft" deleted (by pressing <DEL>) entries
  physically on disk. With other words, there is no undo, so be care-
  ful with it!

+ Addressbook now uses filesharing. That means to can work simultan-
  eously in two different GoldED instances and editing in both the
  addressbook.

+ Added new keyword NICKNAME to define a nickname for main USERNAME.
  Keyword can be used globally and in random user groups.

- GoldED/Lnx: Don't reset to 80x24 on exit (xterm only).

- GoldED/Lnx: For those who had problems with the screen output,
  those problems should be now gone. If not, please report.

+ Added INTERNETDOMAIN <domainstring>, default "username%domain.de",
  which is taken from INTERNETADDRESS "username@domain.de". Here you
  can define what domain the outgoing mails should represent in the
  Message-ID headerline. If you don't know what I'm talking about,
  leave it as default, simply ignore it. It's for those who want to
  tweak GoldED to be maximum RFC1036 compatible.

! Again adjusted the "message origiating" AKA guessing code. See
  ChangeLog (as always) for details.

- GoldED/W32: Due to another bug in the Windows API, GoldED cannot
  really hide the cursor if it is in window mode. So the cursor will
  be moved to the lower left of the screen, where it's tolerable.
  [Odinn: This fix was not good - commented out in the release]

- Fixed SOUPEXPORTMARGIN-Bug. You can now set it back to the default
  again.

- Several fixes to the W32 keyboard code, thanks to Leonid Lisovsky.

- When using MAPPATH in connection with AREAFILE Squish, GoldED some-
  times couldn't read the squish.cfg correctly. Fixed.

- GoldED/W32: Fixed "Escape-key" bug under WinNT, and also some other
  keyboard mapping problems (Leonid Lisovsky <lly@aha.ru>).

! GoldED now knows the "Mailing-List" headerline. It ignores the line,
  however.

- The MSGID/REPLY crc values of SOUP imported emails was incorrectly
  calculated. Fixed.

- GoldED/Lnx: Fileattach-filenames won't be translated to upper-case
  any more.

- The fileattach-filebrowser now also works in Linux-version, thanks
  to patches by Leonid Lisovsky <lly@aha.ru>!

- There was a Y2K bug in the filebrowser fileyear display routine.
  (Yes, is difficult to explain). Fixed.

- PMSCANning in *.msg-areas didn't check the newest msg in the area.

- READmarkingoptions/Mark your personal mail was broken.

- Fixed small quirks in Goldnode/Lnx code.

- Goldnode crashed when it was unable to read even a single NODELIST.

- Goldnode/Lnx was unable to handle wildcards in NODELIST file names.

- GoldED/Lnx wrote wrong REPLIES-files during soup-exporting. Fixed.

- GoldED crashed while accessing the addressbook. Fixed.

______________________________________________________________________

               Notes for pre-3.0.0-1, December 27 1998
                     (first open source release)
______________________________________________________________________

- Goldnode/Lnx couldn't access paths as they were converted to upper
  case during config read. Fixed.

- When SOUP importing, the mailing list feature also processed newsgroup
  articles instead of only emails as it should.

! Removed the following GOLDKEYS.CFG commands, as they're already
  replaced by newer ones since years:

      (old keyword)       (replacement)
    READgotodownlink    READgotoreplyprev
    READgotouplink      READgotoreplies
        <none>          READgotoreply1st
        <none>          READgotoreplynext

  Please adjust your config files.

- GoldED didn't update goldlast.lst when doing soupimport/soupexport
  and using the -noscan cmdline parameter.

- GoldED had not always read the goldlast.lst file correctly,
  especially if the user removed one or more areas between two
  sessions.

- The advanced search feature didn't find all occurences. Previously,
  GoldED did a "shortcircuit"-evaluation to speed up the search, that
  means GoldED stopped scanning a mail before all branches of a
  boolean condition were evaluated under certain conditions. Now,
  GoldED will search a "hit" mail again completely to mark all
  occurences of search-patterns.

! Because some users complained that the popping-up "Wait" - window
  during autosaving is irritating them too much, the window has been
  now replaced by a small statusline message.

- The following goldlang.cfg keywords were incorrectly documented:

    MI_WRITETIHDRYES        "H Use Header: YES "
    MO_NODROP               "N No Drop / ESC  "

  Of course, they are in fact called:

    MI_WRITETOHDRYES        "H Use Header: YES "
    MI_NODROP               "N No Drop / ESC  "

- If you used Goldnode, USERLIST statements and accessed these entries
  in the GoldED nodelist browser, it was likely that GoldED crashed.
  This is now finally fixed.

! Raised the maximum nodelist limit to 45 lists in goldnode.

- Fixed a very serious bug in GoldNode, that caused mysterious
  crashes, misbehaviour or broken index files when compiling. This bug
  has been existing since years in Goldnode, and is most probably the
  cause for any misbehaviour GoldNode users reported in the past time.

- When using "XC: *" or similiar commands, GoldED tried to crosspost
  also to the area separators. Fixed.

- GoldED sometimes jumped to the second marked area after startup when
  using AREAAUTONEXT YES. Hopefully fixed all cases.

- The READthreadtree didn't allow to mark more messages than one
  screensize, because GoldED stopped to advance the cursor-position at
  the end of the window.

! Changed the "INVALIDATE Tearline" default back to the value like it
  was in older days:

    INVALIDATE Tearline "---" "-+-"

  Because of a changed INVALIDATE-handling, the old default work-
  around default setting isn't needed any longer and caused other
  problems.

! The @pseudo will now also be used in the default internal template
  instead of @tfname.

- The @pseudo-token was not always expanded correctly, i.e. when
  quote-replying a mail without using the addressbook during
  header-editing.

- Fixed a bug in Hudson areas where GoldED set the "Snd" flag even if
  Rcv flag was set.

- Fixed '5' key if NUM LOCK was turned off.

- The screen got garbled when doing a addressbook-lookup while editing
  the header and pressing a key that changed a message attribute.

- GoldED didn't set CHRS-kludge correctly if charset translation level
  was != 2.

______________________________________________________________________

                    Notes for Beta5, August 16 1998
______________________________________________________________________

* The Linux version is now compiled with pgcc c++ 1.0.3a with Pentium
  optimization (will still run on 386/486) and is statically linked.

- Fixed Ctrl-J keyboard bug when running the W32 version on NT.

- When using XLATIMPORT IBMPC, XLATEXPORT LATIN-1 and XLATLOCALSET
  LATIN-1 (typical setup for GoldED/Lnx users), GoldED set a wrong
  charset kludge when changing the header of mails. Fixed.

- GoldED will no longer insert the Reply-To: headerline in News/Email
  areas if it is the same as From: headerline.

! During SOUPimport, GoldED will no longer kill mails which are from
  INTERNETADDRESS. Instead, GoldED will now honour the k/s flag during
  SOUPexport, which means that GoldED will delete your selfwritten
  mails after export if you set the k/s flag.

- When using the AREAcatchup key with "marked areas", GoldED did not
  always update the display correctly. Fixed.

- Fixed printing bug.

+ The advanced search features are now also available for marking
  messages via the Alt-S marking menu in the reader. See the Beta4
  notes for details on the capabilities.

+ Implemented better support for tossing mailing list emails to
  different areas. The syntax of the MAILINGLIST keyword was
  inadequate to support pattern matching, so a new keyword MAILTOSS
  has been added, which is actually MAILINGLIST in disguise with the
  parameters reordered and enabling the full set of pattern matching
  as in the new advanced search feature. The syntax of the new keyword
  is:

    MAILTOSS <echoid> <contribution-address> <pattern>

  Note that the contribution address is required. The pattern can be
  written exactly as if in the prompt for the advanced search feature
  (see notes from Beta4).

  Any number of MAILTOSS lines can be given for a particular list, if
  for some reason there is no single way to identify the list.

  When determining the contribution address, the first MAILTOSS (or
  MAILINGLIST) that matches the echoid is chosen.

  MAILTOSS and MAILINGLIST can both be used at the same time and for
  the same lists. MAILINGLIST is always the faster, because it looks
  only at specific headerlines. MAILTOSS uses much more complex
  pattern matching and can even match based on message body content.

  Some examples:

    MAILTOSS list.xircon xircon@xircon.com : "[XIRCON]"
    (match in the subject)

    MAILTOSS list.qmail djb-qmail@koobera.math.uic.edu > "djb-qmail"
    (match in the to/cc/bcc field)

+ Added very limited support for the headerlines Cc: and Bcc:. They
  are now stored internally so that they can be used for the MAILTOSS
  feature. When matching on the To: field, Cc: and Bcc: are checked
  too, if To: doesn't match.

- If F10 was used during editing the header, GoldED did not always
  filled the header fields with correct values.

! GoldED will now jump to the first area with unread mail even at
  startup if using AREAAUTONEXT YES.

- In *.msg netmail areas, but probably at other places too, GoldED
  showed incorrect originating akas if there were no Origin line given
  in the msg. Fixed.

! The GoldED/386 version is released in two editions, one GED386.EXE
  compiled with Watcom and requiring DOS4GW as in versions before
  Beta4. The other is GED386G.EXE, which is compiled with DJGPP (gcc
  2.8.1) and requiring DPMI memory (CWSDPMI.EXE is included to provide
  this service, as DOS4GW does it for the Watcom edition).

- Fixed one cause of the unfreed allocations in geline.cpp. This
  happened during SOUP import, if there were msgs from your
  INTERNETADDRESS. This bug was introduced in Beta3. There may still
  be another cause for the unfreed allocations, since many of the
  reports did not deal with SOUP import. Please check your GOLDED.LOG
  sometimes after starting to run Beta5, to see if these unfreed
  allocations still occur. Don't worry too much about them, they are
  just fairly harmless memory leaks.

  NOTE: BEFORE REPORTING, PLEASE CHECK THE ECHOES FIRST AND SEE IF THE
  PROBLEM HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED!

- Fixed a small bug that could cause a crash during startup when using
  the COLOR config keyword incorrectly.

+ It's now possible to use <F10> during editing the header, which
  allows browsing the addressbook to select a dest name and address.

- COLOR HEADER BTYPE 7 didn't work. Fixed.

! Ged/Lnx: The ESCDELAY will now be only around 100ms, so you probably
  won't notice it any more.

- Fixed another "UNREG UNREG" issue.

- GoldED will no longer auto-add new users to the addressbook if the
  user's name matches one or more of the following conditions:

    1) It's a USERNAME
    2) It's a ROBOTNAME
    3) It's the same as WHOTO
    4) Aka/Address is unknown

! There are now again built-in defaults for ROBOTNAME and FRQEXT as in
  all previous versions.

- When selecting the same addressbook-entry for editing twice, GoldED
  showed wrong values the second time. Fixed.

- Under some circumstances, GoldED jumped to the end-of-list instead
  of just one page down when pressed PgDwn in the arealist-screen.
  Fixed.

! The "scaled down echoid feature" in the arealist-screen has been
  removed again, until it's possible to make it configurable using
  AREALISTFORMAT.

! GoldED will now try to use a valid fido-aka taken from the origin
  line (if existing) before using a valid fido-aka taken from the
  msgid as the originating aka. This is experimental code, please
  report if there are any disadvantages using this method.

! If an area was excluded from pm-scanning, and the user performed a
  pm-scan, the area will now scanned normally. Previously, GoldED
  didn't scan the area at all.

- When forwarding a mail, GoldED selected the origin-line of the
  forwarded message as the origin line of the forwarder message.
  Fixed.

- Keyboard commands on key '5' did only work if Num lock was enabled.
  Probably fixed.

! BEEPFACTOR is now obsolete and has no function any more.

- GoldED did not write GOLDED.MSG if it already existed and the user
  selected External Editor for editing. Fixed.

- GoldED/386 (DJGPP port) did always report "xxx reports error 0: no
  error" when error-exiting. Fixed.

- If ESC was pressed during adding a new addressbook entry, the cursor
  bar disappeared and the program was no longer useable. Fixed.

- If EMPTYTEARLINE YES was used, GoldED filled the tearline with
  garbage. Fixed.

- Fixed a memory overrun problem which occured under some
  circumstances when working with *.MSG areas. It was reported in the
  log as "Pointer error exit at [gmofido1.cpp,112]".

- The addressbook was not properly portable between the Win32 and OS/2
  versions.

______________________________________________________________________

                    Notes for Beta4, July 12 1998
______________________________________________________________________

! GoldED/386 is now compiled with DJGPP (GCC 2.8.1). Because of this,
  DOS4GW.EXE is no longer necessary for GoldED/386.

! In this version, there are no built-in defaults for ROBOTNAME and
  FRQEXT. See the manual for lists that you can include in your
  GOLDED.CFG, if you need these definitions.

- Fixed a bug that could cause the "Could not find anything to
  uudecode in this message" even for valid uuencoded content in a
  message.

- Fixed keyboard code in the Win32 version to work properly with
  Windows 98.

+ Implemented advanced searching features. Currently as an extended
  edition of the find function (alt-f, alt-z), but later a search
  manager (similar to those seen in other programs) and other
  improvements.

  The advanced search is used in much the same way as the old find
  function, but many more options are available and there is some
  changes in behavior.

  Highlights of the new features:

  * Four different pattern matching algorithms to chose from:
    Plain (same as always).
    Shell-style wildcard matching (using * and ?).
    Regex. Uses the FSF extended regular expression library.
    Fuzzy matching. Like plain, but allows one or more mismatches.

  * Logic expressions with "and", "or", "not" can be used.

  * Spaces and option characters can be included in patterns.

  * Exclude or include kludges, tagline, tearline, origin, signature.

  -   Search backward.          Must be first character, if used.
  +   Search forward (default). Must be first character, if used.
  !   Logic not (match when NOT found).
  &   Logic and (match this AND that).
  |   Logic or (match this OR that).
  <   Match "from" header field.
  >   Match "to header field.
  :   Match "subject" header field.
  #   Match message body (but not any control lines).
  .   Match tagline.
  _   Match tearline.
  *   Match origin line.
  @   Match signature.
  %   Match kludges/headerlines.
  =   Match case-sensitive (defaults to not case-sensitive).
  '   Do not match. Place after an option.
  ^   Toggle match. Place after an option.
  ?p  Plain search (default).
  ?r  Regex search.
  ?w  Wildcard search.
  ?f  Fuzzy search with one mismatch allowed.
  ?f2 Fuzzy search with two mismatches allowed.
  ?f3 Fuzzy search with three mismatches allowed.

  You can enclose a pattern string with double ("") or single ('')
  quotes if you want to match a sentence with spaces or which contains
  option characters.

  The backslash is a literal-escape character. If a backslash is
  found, the next character is treated as part of the pattern, not as
  an option character. Use this for example to search for a sentence
  with quotes and spaces.

  Spaces are used as separation characters and are ignored, except
  when enclosed in quotes.

  The first set of option characters on a search expression line is
  used as the "global default". The next set of option characters is
  bound to the following pattern. A pattern is completed by the end of
  the line or by the logic options '&' or '|'.

  If none of the options '<', '>' or ':' are used in the global
  default part, the default is to search all three.

  Some examples:

  To search for the authors name, allowing most common misspellings:
    ?f1 odinn     (matches odin, odinn, oddin, odiin etc)

  To search for OS/2 and Warp 4:
    OS/2 & "Warp 4"

  To search for any occurrance of Odinn or Dirk in the from-line:
    < Odinn | Dirk

  To search for zip file announcements using wildcard matching:
    ?w "*.zip*"

  To search case-sensitive for some string:
    = "All Comes To Those Who Wait"

  Some regular expression searches:
    ?r "Warp *4"    (matches both "Warp 4" and "Warp4")
    ?r "OS/*2" & "Warp *4"

  Due to the many different matching algorithms, the search highlight
  can no longer highlights a matching word, but will instead highlight
  the whole line.

  NOTE: A common mistake will be to forget to escape or quote-enclose
        option characters in pattern strings. For example, what's
        wrong with this, if you want to search for zip files:

          ?w *.zip*

        Nothing, but the first '*' is interpreted as if you want to
        search in origin lines, which is not what you want.

- If echoid of an area was longer than 45 chars and no description was
  given, GoldED was unable to access the area. Fixed.

+ The Echoid's in the arealist screen will now be "scaled down" to
  the maximum available width instead of just being cut off.

- The WaZOO style filerequests didn't work in the Linux-version
  because GoldED used the wrong slashes for the directories. Hopefully
  fixed now.

- FILEALIASes didn't work when using READmakepathreport.

- Fixed write-to-file. When there was an existing file of the same
  name as you wanted to write to, append did not work, but overwrote
  instead. Because of this bug, writing several marked msgs to a file
  did not work either.

- Fixed a bug that could cause the GoldED Win32 version to crash when
  writing to a file.

- Fixed a bug that caused mis-formatted GOLDAREA.INC output.

+ Added AREAFILE Watergate <path>. Reads WaterGate v0.93 and newer.
  Currently none of the imported areas have any group assigned,
  because the group system WaterGate uses is incompatible to GoldED's.
  Suggestions are welcome.

+ Added template expansion token @pseudo. It contains the nick name
  (address book feature) of the destination user if available, else
  @tfname.

  Example:

    Hello @pseudo!

! GoldED will now check SEMAPHORE EXITNOW before any (re-)scanning
  semaphores. This gives you the chance to restart GoldED first before
  scanning the areas (for the case that a new area has arrived).

- GoldED sometimes showed the wrong help category when pressing F1.
  This is now fixed.

+ Added an Address Book for GoldED. It's contents is stored in a file
  named GOLDUSER.LST in the GoldED directory. To list it's contents,
  press ALT-F10 while reading mails. If you press Enter on an entry,
  you can view/edit it. If you press <Ins>, you can manually add a new
  user.

  GoldED will use the aka/address you specified when writing mails.
  [description not complete]

! Changed the default keyboard layout:

  Previously:
    @F10   READtogglemarkread
  now:
    @F10   READuserbase

- GoldED sometimes tried to enter an AREASEP area immediately after
  startup. Fixed.

! GoldED will no longer add an AREA-Kludge in crossposted mails.

+ Updated some menus based on ideas posted in GOLDED.BETA echo.

- Fixed a bug in the Internet address parsing routines that may caused
  crashes.

- the @tmpfile had wrong file modes under GoldED/Lnx. Fixed.

- Previously, it was impossible to save a mail to a file in the
  GoldED/Lnx version. Fixed.

+ It's now possible to use XLATEXPORT ASCII in Email/News areas.
  GoldED will now create appropiate headerlines.

+ Added a very rough mime header encoding routine.

- If GoldED were run in unregistered mode, the statusbar product
  identifier did contain one space too much under some circumstances.
  Cosmetical bug, which is now fixed.

+ Added a new golded.cfg configuration keyword:

    AREAYOUWROTETO <echoid>

  GoldED will automatically copy mails written by you to the specified
  area during saving the mail. GoldED will also add an AREA-Kludge so
  you can see from where the mail originally is copied from.

+ Added a new golded.cfg configuration keyword:

    ADDRESSBOOKADD <no/yes/always>

  Setting it to ALWAYS means that GoldED will always add unknown users
  to the addressbook. If you set the value to YES, GoldED will add
  them only if it's a netmail/email. ADDRESSBOOKADD NO will never
  automatically add a user.

! Temporarily disabled the Zon-Attribute adding in the JAM-Messagebase
  routines. Please report if there are now problems.

- Hopefully fixed a keyboard code bug that caused detecting a "Esc"
  keypress instead of the i.e. cursor keys. If GoldED will detect an
  Esc now, it waits up to half an second if there is in fact a
  different key pressed or not.

- Fixed a bug that caused GoldED to hang/crash when a mail with "?=?"
  in the subject line is read.

- Fixed a bug that caused absolute paths to appear where only
  filenames where requested in the GoldED/Lnx Version. (i.e. the
  @file-token in connection with IMPORTBEGIN).

- Fixed a small bug in search-routines that may cause crashes.

+ Added optional switch /G to AREAFILE Squish. You can now define a
  default group for areas that are imported from squish.cfg by
  configuring

    AREAFILE Squish c:\squish\ /g=G
    AREAFILE Squish c:\squish2\ /g=#103

- Fixed a Test Error Exit at [geedit.cpp, 112] if the quote string got
  longer than (EDIT)QUOTEMARGIN.

+ The READchangetemplate menu will now also display the matching aka
  for every template file if defined.

- If one or more AREASEP's but no mail areas where defined, GoldED
  hung in an infinite loop after startup. Fixed.

- Fixed a crash if msgbase rescanning was performed while selecting a
  destination area for copy/move/forward.

- Fixed Zap Area / Heat Area functionality.

! The arealister will now automatically go one line down after
  pressing AREAtoggle.

+ Advanced the AREAcatchup feature. It'll now display a menu where you
  select whether to catch-up all areas, all marked areas or only the
  current area (default).

+ Added EDITtabreverse, default to #Tab. It's simply the opposite to
  EDITtab.

+ Added AREAdropmsgmarks, default to ^M. [description not complete]

- If the contents of SEMAPHORE EXPORTLIST changed while GoldED was
  running, mail could have been left unscanned in the msgbase. Fixed.
  GoldED will now also try infinite if it can't update one of the
  below mentioned files because of a sharing violation. This is more
  secure than before. If you had problems with unscanned mails in the
  msgbase with older versions, then please try this version and report
  if it works. It should. ;-)

! GoldED will now only update NET/ECHOMAIL.JAM, GOLDQWK.LST,
  GOLDSOUP.LST or SEMAPHORE EXPORTLIST file if it's really necessary.
  This is actually a bugfix in connection with AREAFILE IMail, but
  also may speed up scanning with other tossers.

+ Added sound event EDITCOMPLETION, which happens after a completion
  was done in the internal editor.

! Since it seems that increasing the thread priority for the Win32
  version is a mixed blessing, the default is now to NOT increase the
  priority. Added new commandline option -P to increase the priority
  (Win32 only).

- Fixed keyboard bug in the Win32 version running under NT, where
  Ctrl-Enter did not work.

! For the SOUP feature, the filenames (AREAS, *.MSG etc.) are now
  again uppercase, since it seems that certain programs such as UQWK
  rely on that.

- Fixed "Generate Userlist" feature.

- Fixed a Test Error Exit when crossposting from and into
  AREAREPLYDIRECT YES areas.

+ Added two new functions to the READthreadtree feature, currently
  hardcoded on ^PgUp/^PgDown and <Left>/<Right>. They jump to the
  prev/next new thread. Please make suggestions what you would also
  like to have in the READthreadtree feature.

- Under some rare circumstances, GoldED inserted a space between "---"
  and the tearline text. Fixed.

- When exporting a message from EMail/News areas, the exported header
  wasn't correct. Fixed.

- If GoldED searched for a string and found one exact matching line,
  it didn't detect it as matching. Fixed.

- Fixed several small problems in the filerequest filename detection
  routine.

- When using EDITSPELLCHECK, GoldED reset the cursor position to 1,1
  after re-importing the file into the internal editor. Fixed.

- When forwarding a msg with tagline to an area with disabled
  TAGLINESUPPORT, GoldED inserted a random tagline. Fixed.

- Fixed some minor problems in the arealist screen.

+ Added rough Clipboard support in W32 and OS/2-versions. I'm sorry,
  but "pasting" from Clipboard is currently not possible in OS/2
  version.

+ Added support for 80x28 mode in DOS versions. It's enabled by
  setting SCREENSIZE 28 in GOLDED.CFG

- Fixed two minor problems with INVALIDATE.

- Fixed two minor Squish msgbase problems.

- GoldED sometimes always showed Snt attribute in local hudsonbase
  areas. Fixed.

! GedLnx: AREAFILE filenames should be now all in lowercase.

- Fixed a bug in GoldNODE if german POINTS24 format was used.

- Fixed a bug if STYLECODES NO was set and ToggleStyles was used.

- Fixed display of multiple Replies selection menu in Internet style
  areas.

+ It's now possible to use DOS/4DOS style wildcards for crossposts,
  i.e. "XC: GOLDED*".

- GoldED showed the Internet-address of self-written mails in the
  message lister if MSGLISTFAST YES was set in internet areas. This is
  now fixed for new written mails.

- Previously, GoldED Mime-Header-translated the real name in the mail
  header, but the template @ofrom token contained the non-translated
  variant. Fixed.

! Mime-Header decoding will now also be done in the Replies window, in
  the messagelist and in the threadlist.

! SOUPEXPORTMARGIN will now also be used int the internal editor in
  Internet-areas. This has been added for more WYSIWYG in the editor.
  Note that is still recommended to set EDITHARDTERM NO if
  Soup-Exporting is done via GoldED. If you use a third party software
  for that job, you should set EDITHARDTERM YES for those areas.

! AREACOPYADDID YES: GoldED will now insert an ^aAREA Kludge instead
  of the old AREA: - so called "kludge". In addition it won't insert a
  kludge if the destination is a netmail area. This is because of some
  problems with mails containing an "AREA:" line.

- When Deleting marked messages that had DEL and Loc/Uns attributes
  set, GoldED asked for confirmation. Fixed.

- Fixed two bugs in AREALISTSORT in connection with the AREASEP
  feature. Now sortspecs like "GE" or "GTE" should work as expected.

  Note: If "T" is one of the primary sortings (i.e. prior to "G"),

    AREASEP X "desc" 0 Net

  means that this Area-Separator is sorted in front of the first
  Netmail area, regardless which group it has.

  Otherwise, if "G" is one of the primary sortings (prior to "T"),

    AREASEP Y "desc 2" 0 Echo

  means that this Area-Separator is sorted in front of the first area
  without group (Groupid = '0'). If "T" is one of the secondary
  sorting types, the Area-Separator is sorted in front of the first
  area with group = 0 and Type = Echo. If there's an area with group=0
  and type=Net, the Area-Separator is sorted below that area, i.e.:

    AREADEF NETMAIL "..." 0 Net [...]
    AREASEP Y       "..." 0 Echo
    AREADEF ECHO1   "..." 0 Echo [...]

+ Added AREAselectmarks. Default is ALT-R. [description not complete]

- AREACOPYADDID YES/NO didn't work if globally defined.

- Fixed a crash if -INSTALL was used and no AREAFILE was detected.

+ MAPPATH can now remap up to 127 chars long paths.

- Hopefully fixed NODELISTWARN YES bug.

+ Added functions for deletion of left/right words in the header edit.
  You can use them by pressing ^Backspace and ^T.

- GEDLNX -? didn't work. Fixed.

- Fixed some problems with the new format of GOLDLAST.LST.

- GoldED did not always show the size of attached files correctly if
  MAPPATH was used. Fixed.

- If AREAPMSCAN * wasn't in golded.cfg, ALT-P, A in the
  arealist-screen didn't work. Fixed.

! The READtogglestyles-menu has been removed and replaced by a variant
  similar to the Toggle Twits dialog.

! Changed the handling of the Toggle Twits dialog. You can now browse
  through it by pressing READtoggletwits several times. Previously,
  after you accidently came over "Kill Twit msgs", they were killed.
  You can now select a mode by waiting around 3 seconds of by pressing
  Enter.

- The strings for "Twit displayed " and "Twit killed" in the Toggle
  Twits dialog were swapped. Fixed.

- The arrived/received date wasn't updated during saving the mail.
  Fixed.

+ EDITSOFTCRXLAT-translation is now also done in the header.

- Fixed some problems in Stylecodes-detection.

- There were several problems in the updated fast-filerequest feature
  of Beta3. They're now fixed. Note if you still have problems or if
  GoldED doesn't detect something/detects something wrong, please
  report it!

- If you were in the "attach files" dialog and tried to toggle a
  header message attribute, the screen was garbled. Fixed it by
  disabling editing the attributes while you're in this dialog. Note
  that it still works during editing the header, so there should be no
  problem.

+ Added a new menu to the Import File - dialog in the internal editor.
  You can now import binary files as base64 encodings. It's now also
  possible to select the charset the imported file has. (i.e. if you
  import a text that was written in a Windows-application or under
  Linux, you should select "LATIN1 -> IBMPC" translation).

+ GoldED will now write messages to the file "golded.txt" if you
  entered in fact a directory.

- Fixed NetName-detection in origin if a message was changed.

- If you changed the attributes of a message, the MSGID was changed.
  Fixed.

- If you used a random origin/tearline/tagline, it wasn't expanded
  under every circumstance. Fixed.

- Fixed unfreed allocation at [gecmfd.cpp,304].

- Fixed unfreed allocation at [gerand.cpp,163].

- If you were in FromNode/DestNode Lookup (F10/#F10) and pressed ^Q,
  Golded didn't quit. Fixed.

! READthreadtree has now keyboard default '#', to be compatible to the
  german point program "Crosspoint".

- GoldED didn't detect changes to GOLDED.KEY. Fixed.

+ Added global switch AREACATCHUPREAD <yes/no>. Default is YES. If set
  to NO, GoldED won't reset new messages to read if HIGHLIGHTUNREAD
  YES is used and AREAcatchup is executed.

- Fixed wrong paths in NET/ECHOMAIL.JAM in Linux-version.

- Fixed GoldNODE-Index lookup in Linux-version.

- Fixed Logfile-Dump of Linux-version. Previously, GoldED just
  wrote "Linux 0.00 reports error 0: no error" ;-)

- Fixed a bug in the " Exit Area? " menu.

- GoldED set the ReCeiVed attribute on messages with empty to:-lines
  if INTERNETADDRESS wasn't set.

! Replaced the stylecodes - menu by a variant similiar to the
  ToggleTwitsettings menu as requested by some users.

+ Added the following help categories to GOLDHELP.CFG:

    1010     menu READchangexlatimport
    2007     menu AREAdropmsgmarks
    2008     menu AREAcatchup
    3015     menu READgotouplink
    3016     READreplythread lister
    5003     menu when importing files in the internal editor
    6000     addressbook users lister
    6001     menu when editing an addressbook user

- The LOOKUPNET NO fix was broken. Fixed.

- Fixed several small bugs in the UUCP-mails handling that were
  introduced in Beta3 and before.

! Changed the STYLECODES YES code to be less restrictive. If it fails,
  please report the error.

- If INTENSECOLORS NO was set, GoldED didn't toggle on the blinking
  attribute. Fixed.

! It's now again possible to forward messages from areas that were
  defined with AREAREPLYDIRECT YES.

- Fixed a GoldED-SOS-Dump when using AREAcatchup with a Hudsonbase
  area that contained only one (new) message.

- Fixed crashes and faulty display in the arealist screen.

! Removed the following GOLDLANG.CFG keywords, as they are no longer
  used:

    ST_MARKINGCHAIN
    WL_MOVEFILEBAR
    WL_TOGGLEFILE
    WL_ACCEPTFILES
    WL_SELECTALLFILES
    WL_ABORTFILES
    MS_FROMTWIT
    MI_DISKFILENOHDR
    MI_PRINTERNOHDR

+ Added the following GOLDLANG.CFG keywords with the given defaults:

    MI_GOTONEXTNEW          "U Yes, Next Unread Area. "
    WT_FORWARD              " Use FWD kludges? "
    MI_FORWARDYES           "Y       Yes Please.      "
    MI_FORWARDNO            "N           No!          "
    IL_WARNLOCKED           " WARNING! This message is LOcKed! "
    IL_NOTHREADLIST         " Sorry, no thread available. Press key "
    IL_STYLECODESNO         " Stylecodes disabled "
    IL_STYLECODESYES        " Stylecodes enabled "
    IL_STYLECODESHIDE       " Stylecodes enabled and stripped "

    MI_CATCHCURRENT         "C Catch Current  "
    MI_NOCATCH              "N No Catch / ESC "

! The 16-bit DOS version was too large to compile, so to be able to
  continue to release it at all, I had to remove some of the least
  used msgbase formats. This means that the 16-bit DOS version no
  longer has support for Ezycom, PCBoard, WildCat! and Goldbase. If
  you need these msgbase formats, please use the 32-bit DOS version or
  another platform.

  Even with these msgbase formats removed, the 16-bit DOS version
  still doesn't have much free memory to work with, and you will
  probably experience "out of memory" often. You should seriously
  consider switching to one of the 32-bit versions instead.

______________________________________________________________________

                   Notes for Beta3a, March 21 1998
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed crash when trying to decode malformed RFC2047 encoded words.

- Under some circumstances, FTN addresses could appear in the header
  display when in an area marked as email or news. This would happen
  in cases where there was no To: or From: header. Cosmetic.

- When entering a msg in echomail or local areas, a date was shown in
  the to-line in the header editor. Cosmetic.

- Fixed a crash in the arealist when there were not enough areas to
  fill the window.

- Fixed AREAFILE Squish, which did not find Squish areas if there was
  no "-$" on its own in NETAREA/ECHOAREA lines.

- Through a horrifying mistake, the AdeptXBBS msgbase code was in fact
  never included in Beta1, 2 and 3. Fixed. SORRY!!!!!!!!!

______________________________________________________________________

                    Notes for Beta3, March 17 1998
______________________________________________________________________

! The 16-bit DOS version is now compiled in the "huge" memory model.
  This was necessary to be able to compile it at all. Unfortunately
  this decreases performance and bloats the EXE, and you still need
  quite a lot of free DOS memory to run it for any length of time. You
  should be prepared that this is probably near the end of the line
  for the 16-bit DOS versions :-(

- Fixed a bug that caused problems if you were overriding an area with
  one echoid with another with the same echoid, but a different
  msgbase type.

+ Added commandline option -exportsoup. If used, GoldED exports
  mail/news to SOUP at startup. If both -exportsoup and -importsoup is
  used, import is performed first, then export.

+ Added commandline option -noscan. If used, the startup scan (if any)
  is skipped. This is useful for automated SOUP import/export in a
  batch file. For example "-noscan -importsoup @x y" imports SOUP then
  exits.

- Fixed a bug in the JAM-routines that garbled messages if they were
  copied from and to JAM-areas. Some kludges (like REPLYTO, REPLYADDR
  and many others) were removed from the subfields. This caused
  problems with third-party utils that accessed the copied mails.

- DateReceived will now be set to the current local time when a
  self-written mail is saved the first time. If the msgbase doesn't
  support DateReceived, DateProcessed will be set instead. This
  prevents some problems with stupid msgbase-maintenance utils.

- If a mail was copied from an non-squish-area to a squish-area, it
  was scanned out again as a duplicate message. Fixed.

- Fixed "Snd"-Attribute - detection in Hudson/Goldbase areas. If a
  mail was copied from an Hudson/Goldbase area to another, it was
  scanned out again as a dupe message. Fixed.

- FRQWAZOO YES has been updated to handle the "dir" attribute
  correctly.

- If LOOKUPNET NO was used, it had been impossible to enter a
  destination address in netmail areas. Fixed.

+ Added AREAFILE Partoss <filespec>. Note that "filespec" must be the
  full path to and including "partoss.cfg", because AREAFILE ParToss
  currently calls the same config reader as AREAFILE Squish.

+ AREAFILE Squish has been updated to interpret the following flags in
  area definitions:

    -$gX       Set group of area to 'X'. 'X' may be 'A'..'Z'.
    -$n<desc>  Set desc of area to 'desc'. 'desc' must be enclosed by
               '"'s if it contains spaces.

  ParToss, a Squish-clone written by Serge V. Koghin (2:5030/177), can
  handle and inserts these flags.

! AREAFILE Squish <filespec> can now also handle the case when
  <filespec> points to a file, not to a directory, i.e.

    AREAFILE Squish d:\path\mysquish.cfg

  The previously used syntax:

    AREAFILE Squish d:\path -c=mysquish.cfg

  has been removed.

- Fixed shelling in the Linux version.

- Fixed printing in the Linux version.

- Fixed the disappearing cursor in the Linux version.

- Fixed faulty right borders in the Linux version.

- Fixed Tab key in the Linux version.

- Fixed mangling of highbit characters in the Linux version after an
  overlaying window was closed.

- Fixed a quoting bug that caused quoted text to disappear. This
  happened if there was a long kludge just before the normal line to
  be quoted.

+ Improved speed of the Win32 version by increasing the thread
  priority for the program.

+ AREAFILE IMail is now ready for v1.87. NOTE: This version of IMail
  was not yet available at the time of writing.

- Fixed some problems with Path-Mapping. It's now possible to use
  AREAFILE IMail in connection with MAPPATH (didn't work before).

! Keyword MAPDRIVE has been replaced by MAPPATH. The old keyword
  MAPDRIVE is now obsolete, please remove it from your config!

  The new syntax is: MAPPATH <filespec> <filespec>.

  e.g.

    MAPPATH C: J:              ; compatible to MAPDRIVE
    MAPPATH C:\ /mnt/dos/c/    ; For GoldED/LNX AREAFILE's.

- Fixed INVALIDATE handling.

- Fixed ADDRESSMACRO in connection with EMail-areas. It is now
  possible to use the following:

  ADDRESSMACRO dam,dirk.mueller@rhein-neckar.de (Dirk A. Mueller),,

- Fixed a small bug during header-edit if an EMail was written in a
  netmail area. Note that is currently impossible to reply a
  gated-EMail into an EMail-area. This will be done in a future
  release.

- Fixed a bug if a gated EMail was PGP-encrypted. Previously, the
  To:-Line was also encrypted and was missing afterwards. This is now
  fixed. Note that is defined behaviour that the To:-line is inserted
  during _saving_ the mail, not before editing the text, as before.

  If you need to change the destination address, you can do it in the
  header-edit.

- GoldED hung the computer if "Toggle all marks" was used and around
  the half of all msgs were marked. Fixed.

+ GoldED will now store the message-marks (and Personal Mails) between
  sessions.

! Changed the format of GOLDLAST.LST. You _/should/_ delete GOLDLAST.*
  in your GoldED-directory (if AREAKEEPLAST YES) before starting this
  new version.

+ GoldED's statusline-clock won't stop any longer if a popup-warning
  is on the screen.

- During header-edit, GoldED inserted it's PID in every message.
  Fixed.

! SQUISHDIRECT YES will now strip Cra+Hld attribute during header
  display. This may be confusing to you at first, but it is much more
  intentional.

- Fixed several "incarnations" of the charset-translation bug. GoldED
  did not always translate correctly during crossposting, editing
  header attributes and exporting to the quotebuffer.

- Fixed a bug with "AREA:"-Kludge in netmail-areas.

- It was impossible to write a mail with "@position" in the mailtext.
  Fixed.

- Fixed another charset-translation bug if READchangeattrs was used.

- Fixed "unfreed allocation" at geread.cpp. This caused crashes if
  READgotonextunread/READgotoprevunread was used multiple times.

! If READnewarea is pressed in the message-list, the lastread-pointer
  is no longer updated. This is much more intentional.

- It is now possible to use the following Keyboard assignments:

  Esc    LISTmacro LISTselect READnewarea
  Esc    READmessagelist

  If enabled, you can go to the message-lister by pressing ESC and can
  jump from the messagelister directly to the arealist-screen by
  pressing ESC _again_.

! Screen output is now much faster in W32-versions. In addition, the
  new code is smaller than the old one.

- If READgotonextarea or READgotoprevarea was used, GoldED sometimes
  assumed wrong options. Fixed.

+ GoldED won't ask for "Zonegating yes/no?" any longer if Cra or Hld
  attribute is set.

+ Added a new menu option in the "Newarea"-Menu. Now you can go to the
  arealist-screen by pressing <Y> or <Right>, or immediately jump to
  the next area with new mail by pressing <Enter>.

+ Added support for the ^AENCLFILE kludge. This is only used in
  JAM-Areas. However GoldED doesn't add it in new mails.

+ Improved the Filerequest-Feature. It should be now much more
  reliable and it should also display the filesize of the requestable
  files, if given in the announcement. Please tell me if GoldED
  detects something wrong.

+ Added error-messages if there was an error during Shelling out.

+ Added a warning if a commandline > 125 chars is used for Externutils
  in the GoldED- and GoldED/386 version.

- If no area was marked in the arealist-screen, and the cursor was
  just above a separator, AREAjump jumped on the separator. Fixed.

+ Added READthreadtree. There is currently no default key assignment
  for it, please make suggestions. This feature is not yet finished,
  please tell me if you have any ideas to improve it.

+ Added a menu READtogglestyles. Default assignement: CTRL-H. Toggles
  stylecodes-options. The default is "Stripping", if STYLECODES YES is
  used.

- "USERNAME Odinn Sorensen, 2:236/77" caused GoldED to crash if no
  other ADDRESS/AKA was given. Fixed.

- Fixed SYS3175 if undefined AKA was used in AREA or AREADEF.

- SQUISHSCAN API didn't work. Fixed. Note if you experience wrong
  values in the arealist-screen after area-scanning, you should use
  this switch. If SQUISHSCAN QUICK works under you setup, then use it,
  as it is faster.

! The memory debugging code has been re-activated. It'll work also in
  the Linux version now. PLEASE NOTE: The debug code caused the EXE to
  grow about 100k larger and you should expect some performance
  decrease.

- OS/2: After shelling out, CTRL-S didn't work any longer. Fixed.

- W32: After shelling out, keyboard input was echoed to screen under
  some circumstances. Fixed.

! The following obsolete keywords have been removed. Please replace
  them with the newer, valid variant if you still have them in your
  config:

      old                  new
    BOARDNOS            AREALISTNOS
    CHANGEPROMPT        DOSPROMPT
    CLEARKEYS           KEYBCLEAR
    DELORIG             ASKDELORIG
    DISPSTYLECODES      STYLECODES
    ELIMSNOW            SCREENELIMSNOW
    EXTKEYS             KEYBEXT
    HWMARKS             FIDOHWMARKS
    LISTWRAP            DISPLISTWRAP
    LOCALHIGHLIGHT      DISPLOCALHIGH
    LOCALNOISE          BEEPLOCALMSG
    MATCHAKA            AKAMATCHNET
    NEXTAREA            AREAAUTONEXT
    NEXTMSGS            DISPAUTONEXT
    PAGEBAR             DISPPAGEBAR
    REALMSGNO           DISPREALMSGNO
    SAYBIBI             BEEPNOISES
    SHADOWS             SCREENSHADOWS
    SPACEQUOTES         QUOTESPACING
    USEBIOS             SCREENUSEBIOS

+ GOLDED.CFG: Literal strings can now also contain string delimiters.
  That means you can declare something like:

  AREADEF GOLDED "About the message reader \"GoldED\" and tools" [...]

  This will be now parsed correctly everywhere.

- If a mail with "MSGID 1:234/567@OS/2-Net" was read by GoldED, it
  showed "1:234/2" in the header and not, as it should be,
  "1:234/567". Fixed. However, note that only alphanumeric chars are
  allowed inside domains!

! GoldED will now also look for "NODEX.SDX" if using the V7-index.
  This has been added for greater compatibility with Fastlst 2.xx.

+ Added SEMAPHORE EXITNOW <filepath>. GoldED will exit immediately if
  this semaphore file is found and it is idle in the arealist screen.

- Previously, it was impossible to overlay a key with an default
  assignment with a user-macro. This is fixed now, so there should be
  no need for KEYBDEFAULTS NO any longer!

- Fixed a reflow-bug in the internal editor; if a line with maximum
  length was reflowed, GoldED did delete the last character.

- Fixed some small problems with SOUP signatures.

+ Added a warning if you want to delete a message with LOK attribute
  set.

- Fixed "Mark thread" function. It will mark now all mails of the
  current thread, not just a chain as before. However, the
  implementation is yet quick'n'dirty.

- Fixed "Nodelist out of date" warning if the browser was first
  accessed.

- Fixed several "wrong aka/akamatching" problems.

! GoldED will now automatically save the arealist data to GOLDLAST.LST
  after a semaphore-rescan has been performed. This is much more save
  and useful.

- Fixed a reflow-bug in connection with mails from "Crosspoint" users.

! GoldED will no longer strip leading spaces from quotes. Before,
  GoldED reformatted

    XX>      y = x^2
    XX>  lim x -> oo

  to this:

    XX>> y = x^2
    XX>> lim x -> oo

  Now, it will reformat it to the following:

    XX>>     y = x^2
    XX>> lim x -> oo

  Please report if this is ok or if there are any new problems /
  problems left.

+ Added "path report" feature. New Keyboard command
  READmakepathreport, defaults to Ctrl-K. The output file can be
  processed by a new "RDDT" (Route Diagram Drawing Tool) utility,
  which will be available separately. [documentation not complete].

- MAPDRIVE will be now also used when writing ECHOMAIL.JAM /
  NETMAIL.JAM. This allows you again to use these files if you need
  MAPDRIVE for reading the AREAFILEs correctly.

! All global on/off switches in the GOLDED.CFG will now be parsed by a
  general cfg reader class. There should be _no_ difference for you as
  a user. The current implementation is just smaller and somehow
  faster. It is the first step to a better config reader.

+ AREAcatchup (ALT-C in the arealist-screen) will now also set all
  messages to "read" if HIGHLIGHTUNREAD is enabled. Note that GoldED
  won't reset the complete msgbase but only those messages after the
  lastread-pointer, just for speed reasons.

+ Added COLOR READER QUOTE2. The default is White on black. GoldED
  shows now quotes with different "quote-levels" in different colors.
  To disable this feature, set COLOR READER QUOTE2 to the same value
  as COLOR READER QUOTE.

+ Added support for SOUP-signatures. GoldED will now detect if a
  template contains a signature and will handle it correctly.

- Fixed Shift-F10 in the header-edit.

- If TWITMODE KILL was set, GoldED didn't allow to toggle the twitmode
  in the reader. Fixed.

+ Added the goldlang.cfg keyword "IL_TWITKILLED". The default is
  " Twit Msgs Killed ".

- When forwarding a message, GoldED sometimes used a "random"
  template. Fixed.

- When forwarding a message and changing the Subject line, GoldED
  replaced the template token "@subject" by the new subject instead of
  the old one. Fixed.

+ It is now possible to use "replacement" tokens inside "command
  tokens" in templates. Example:

    @forward@forcesubj[FWD] @subject

  If you forward a message, GoldED will now automatically insert
  "[FWD] " in front of the old subject line.

! New entered mails are now always considered as read.

! The "generate userlist" functionality has been changed based on
  ideas of Thomas Keusch (Thank you!!). GoldED will now use the aka of
  the latest message of each user in the area (Think of situations
  where the aka of a user has changed) and it will be now
  case-sensitive ("MICHAEL MUELLER" and "Michael Mueller" are now two
  different users). As a side-effect, this routine is now MUCH faster.
  :-)

! GoldED won't import SOUP messages if they are from INTERNETADDRESS
  any longer. This is a workaround for the problem that SOUPER re-gets
  news that are written by the user and therefore all self-written
  news are stored twice in the messagebase.

! GoldED will now update the "DateProcessed" timestamp in JAM-soup
  email/news when exporting mails.

- GoldED will now use MAPDRIVE when displaying mails with files
  attached to it.

+ GoldED can use now a file as a list for crossposting. This was
  considered as a bug, because this is already documented (?), but it
  was in fact never implemented. ;-) The stuff has now been added.

! GoldED will now insert an AREA-kludge in crossposts _if_
  AREACOPYADDID is enabled in the individual destination area. A
  "Youwrote" - function will be added in a later release.

! GoldED will now show the INTERNETADDRESS in the header if the area
  is a SOUP area instead of the current aka. This is only cosmetical
  and has no effect. ;-)

- Fixed a crash if subject-line is longer than 500 chars. This can
  only happen in internet-areas, and has in fact happened with a
  subject line of 900 chars. ;-)

+ Improved the keyboard code in the Win32 version to give much better
  speed and to work better under both Win95 and NT.

+ Added support for the new version 4 keysystem. A version 4 key is a
  file named GOLDED.KEY, which must be in the same directory as
  GOLDED.CFG. The first line of a version 4 key file contains an
  identifier and the name of the registered user. This name must be in
  your list of USERNAME's or REGISTERNAME.

- GoldED wasn't able to update the timesread-field in *.MSG areas if
  the Lok-attribute was set. In this case it displayed "<area> is
  locked. Wait..." forever. Fixed.

- The destination-lookup invoked in the header by pressing Shift-F10
  didn't work. It didn't take over the selected aka. Fixed. Note that
  GoldED won`t open the browser window if there's only one entry
  matching the current to-name.

- If the user has entered a fuzzy search string in the arealist-screen
  and invoked "Zap/Heat areas", GoldED started to behave strangely and
  maybe stop working completely. Fixed.

- If SEMAPHORE IDLETIME was used, GoldED didn't start the
  screenblanker in the arealist-screen any longer. Now, both the
  screenblanker and the scanning-semaphores will work again together.

- GoldED did export SOUP-messages even if they have had a DEL-(JAM) or
  Lok-flag. Fixed.

- Fixed a bug that caused V7-NODEFLAGS to be wrong.

+ Added COLOR READER SIGNATURE. This color is used for the internet-style
  signatures. The default is DGrey on Black.

- Fixed all (?) "skipping separator" - problems in the arealist.

- Fixed crash at startup if SEMAPHORE IDLETIME was used.

- Fixed the "stuck template" problem.

- Fixed sort order AREALISTSORT GO, when arealist separators (such as
  AREASEP !A "A" A Local) where defined as Local, causing them to be
  sorted after the areas in their group.

- Fixed AREAFILE AdeptXBBS for the "no areas" bug and added support
  for AdeptXBBS areas in Squish, Fido and JAM formats. OS/2 only.

______________________________________________________________________

                           Notes for Beta2
______________________________________________________________________

- Fixed several bugs in connection with FIDOUSERLIST that may cause
  crashes or strange behaviour.

- Fixed ADDRESSMACROs so that they work in EMail-areas again.

- Fixed crash when SoupExporting and XLATEXPORT was not set to
  MNEMONIC, LATIN1QP or LATIN1.

- Fixed probably most of the AREASEP-sorting problems. If there are
  still any left, please report them.

- Fixed broken "End/Home" in the arealist-screen if first/last area
  was a AREASEP-line. Note that the wraparound-bug (no wraparound
  possible if first/last area is AREASEP, although DISPWRAPAROUND is
  enabled) is not yet fixed.

+ During editing in the header, it is now possible to do a NL-lookup
  by pressing SHIFT-F10. In addition, the To-Name/Addr-fields will be
  updated if the user selected a different destination in the browser.

- GoldED didn't translate MIME-codes in the header in fido (gated
  newsgroups) echos. Fixed. Now, if MSGLISTFAST NO is set, GoldED will
  also translate the mime-headers while viewing them in the
  messagelister.

- Fixed the multiple " UNREG" in tearline problem.

+ Added support for the "X-Mailing-List:" - RFC headerline. The
  MAILINGLIST keyword will recognize it.

+ GoldNODE can now handle up to 30 nodelists. The previous limit was
  20, otherwise it crashed. GoldNODE will now print an error message.

+ GoldNODE can now read the german POINTS24-format directly!  You can
  now remove your 3d -> 4d converter.

- Fixed some GoldNODE problems.

- GoldED will now also know lines beginning with "Resent-" as valid
  kludge lines (SOUP).

- "RFC: x lines" wasn't detected as a known kludge. Fixed.

- Fixed "cannot decode" if UUDECODEPATH wasn't set.

! GoldED will no longer use the Autoattach-Feature if "a:" or "b:" is
  at the beginning of the subject line.

- Fixed bug that NODEV7MODEM b0 was not displayed even if correctly
  configured.

+ Added support for V7+. It's automatically used if your NODEPATHV7 is
  set correctly. If GoldED shows "xxxx / NODEX.DTP" at the bottom of
  the browser window, the displayed information is taken from the raw
  nodelist entry.

- V7 / FD / FU - Nodelist-access will now also work under GoldED/LNX.

+ Added new "catch up" command in the arealist. Key command
  AREAcatchup, default assignment Alt-C. The effect of this command is
  to point the lastread pointer to the last message in the current
  area.

- Fixed some more bugs in the filerequest function.

+ Added new keyword ATTACHPATH <path>. It sets the default path for
  fileattaches.

- Fixed some bugs in filerequest function if many files were requested
  and/or FRQOPTIONS NOWAZOOMSG wasn't used (FRQWAZOO YES).

+ Added new functionality to "Select Reply" window. Now unread replies
  are marked and the cursorbar is positioned on the first unread reply
  by default.

! Previously it wasn't possible to use '^h  EDITmacro "^h"' because of
  a bug in the internal editor. This is now fixed.

- Fixed bug in the RFC822 Date: header parser, which caused a hang if
  the header was not 100% correct. Changed the implementation to a
  robust one and also changed the *.MSG date parser to a robust one,
  just in case.

- Added GID as a known kludge.

- Fixed PCBoard crossposting bug that caused empty messages to be
  crossposted.

- The origins from AREAFILE's were ignored.

- The AREAFILE Maximus reader was not working for Maximus 2.xx. Not
  tested.

- Fixed a bug that caused strange problems if GOLDED.CFG contained
  tabs instead of spaces.

- Fixed bug in the personal mail feature. If there were multiple areas
  with personal mails, GoldED didn't always start with the first
  unread personal mail but somewhere in between.

- Fixed "Message is already sent" problems in *.MSG-areas (type=echo).

- Fixed "fuzzy search" bug in the arealist-browser.

- Fixed "wrong row in statusline" while editing in the internal
  editor.

- Fixed editor range check warning if browsing over the end-of-file
  marker.

- Fixed garbage at the right corner in the internal editor if
  DISPMARGIN < 80.

- Fixed garbage on screen if DISPMARGIN is bigger than allowed.

! The default wildcard for the filebrowser was "*.*". Changed to "*",
  as it should be.

- AREACOPYADDID was only active if enabled in the <from>-area. Now it
  is active for the area the mail is copied TO, as it should be. In
  addition it does no longer inserts an AREA-kludge if the destination
  area is a netmail-area.

- Fixed wrong color "painting" in the fileattach-menu after pressing
  Ctrl-Enter.

- Fixed faulty extended keyboard detection in the DOS-versions.

- Fixed wrong version in the PID.

______________________________________________________________________

                           Notes for Beta1
______________________________________________________________________

+ Implemented a different memory debugging feature to GoldED/2. The
  feature is enabled with the commandline option -X. When enabled,
  GoldED switches to allocating memory directly with DosAllocMem and
  places the data so that overruns (access beyond the end of allocated
  memory) will cause an immediate SYS3175. If you suspect a bug,
  please try running GoldED with this feature enabled for a while.
  NOTE: When this feature is enabled, GoldED uses a lot more memory
  (for example 8192 bytes per line in a msg), so be sure to have
  plently of swapspace.

- GoldED/2 crashed when trying to file attach with wildcards.

- When move-replying a msg from an "AREAREPLYDIRECT YES" area to
  another area, and the msg didn't contain an AREA: kludge, GoldED
  crashed. If it *did* contain an AREA: kludge, the @oecho and @odesc
  template tokens were not correct.

- If a very long WT_NEWAREA language text was used and a long fuzzy
  string was entered (such as pressing 'A' continuously), the screen
  was garbled and GoldED crashed in some cases.

- You could not enter the '^' character in the normal manner in the
  Win32 version.

+ The Win32 version now sets the window titlebar text. Also added a
  bit more orderly shutdown when ctrl-break is pressed.

- Fixed bug in the internal editor. When backspacing from column one,
  the Linux version crashed.

- The Linux version did not react properly to Ctrl-Q and Ctrl-S keys.

+ Optimized screen access for the Linux version a bit more, and added
  support for alternate charset, so that border lines etc. are drawn
  using highbit characters, not ugly ascii. NOTE: If you see a lot of
  strange characters instead of nice lines, you are most likely using
  setfont or something else that destroys the screen mapping that
  allows alternate charsets to work. GoldED uses basically the same
  method for switching charsets as ncurses and slang, so you would
  have the same problems with programs built with those libraries.

+ In the arealist, GoldED now automatically skips past area separator
  lines when moving over them.

+ GoldED now decodes MIME (RFC2047) encoded headers (you know, the
  ugly =?ISO-8859-1?Q?bl=ABla?= things). Note: The charset is
  currently ignored. This is okay for most msgs. Will be done properly
  in a later version. Encoding is not supported.

- Fixed MIME quoted-printable support for SOUP export. During export,
  the header lines were also quoted-printable encoded.

- When using ALT-Z (EDITzapquotesbelow) and there were only quotes
  below the cursor until the end of the mail (nothing else), GoldED
  hung or crashed.

- After using ALT-Z (EDITzapquotesbelow) and there was no "normal"
  selfwritten line between the cursor-position and the end of the mail
  but only a origin/tearline/tagline-line, GoldED displayed these
  lines in the wrong color.

- GoldED will no longer crash when importing a 1-byte SOUP message to
  a JAM area.

- When exporting news from a Squish area, GoldED forgot to set the Scn
  attribute, so the articles afterwards appeared with the attributes
  "Snt Uns Loc".

! The FRQOPTION USEFLOFILE option is now permanently on. You can
  remove that option from your configuration, if you have it.

+ Changed the MAILINGLIST feature so that it also looks at the From:
  line instead of just the Sender: line.

+ GoldED now knows about the Squish "Lok" attribute with attribute
  value 0x40000000.

- When changing attributes on a msg in an area like the BAD_MSGS area,
  the AREA: line was moved to a position where the mail processor
  couldn't find it.

+ In areas marked as e-mail or newsgroups, GoldED now allows full
  editing of both name and internet address when in the header editor.

+ Instead of AREAFILE TMail, you can now use AREAFILE Termail. It
  calls the same config reader.

- Fixed CARBONCOPYLIST NAMES when using a large amount of CC's (i.e.
  taken from a file). GoldED created netmails for all cc-members, but
  only inserted the first line of "CC: <name>, <name>, <name>,
  <name>"-text and forgot the others.

- Cutting out a large block in the internal editor caused a range
  check error message.

- GoldED crashed when copying, moving or forwarding to the same area.

- Fixed crash if the description column "D" was not defined in
  AREALISTFORMAT.

+ New feature: GoldED can now jump to the next or previous unread msg
  (unread being defined as having timesread = 0). Added the new key
  commands READgotonextunread and READgotoprevunread for this feature.

  The default key assignements are:

    @U     READgotonextunread    ; Like in Yuppie
    @Left  READgotoprevunread
    @Right READgotonextunread

  This feature is very useful when using the reply-linking to read a
  complete thread and afterwards switch to the next unread mail
  automatically.

+ Added new keyword: SOUPEXPORTMARGIN <margin>. Defaults to 76. This
  is the margin that GoldED will hard-wrap to when exporting to SOUP
  packets. If you're getting complaints that your lines are too long,
  you may want to set this to 70 or 60. NOTE: You should NOT enable
  EDITHARDTERM in email and newsgroups that are exported to SOUP. If
  you do, your messages will probably be exported with short line
  "droppings" after the wrapping margin.

- The various semaphore files are now deleted *after* performing the
  desired action instead of before.

- MAILINGLIST areas were not automatically changed to type "EMail".

+ GoldED now also highlight the to-field if it contains the
  INTERNETADDRESS.

+ Added an end-of-message indicator line in the internal editor. It's
  a line from left to right and has COLOR READER BORDER.

- GoldED didn't write the correct entry in the .REQ file, when writing
  the following in the subj-line of a wazoo-filerequest:

    GEOA1026.ZIP $365000

  The $-stuff is now saved on the same line as the filename, similiar
  to the password - '!' functionality.

- If there were a ^B (0x02) character somewhere in the message, GoldED
  also deleted the succeeding character when saving the mail.

- The current LOADLANGUAGE (global or in a group) is now reloaded
  after posting a message. This prevents "stuck" language.

- Fixed template-matching bug. It could cause a template to be falsely
  matched when entering a new message or a comment-reply in an
  echomail or local area.

+ Default colors have now been assigned to the stylecode highlighting:

    COLOR STYLECODE ALL White on Black

  Remember to enable the DISPSTYLECODES keyword if you want to see
  any effect of this.

- If you used CTRL-N/CTRL-P while reading messages to go directly to
  the next area and there was a AREASEP-definition in between, GoldED
  crashed.

- In quoted-printable encoded messages, if there was an encoded TAB
  character, it was decoded wrongly and the next character was lost.

- When doing large amount of copying/moving that takes a while, GoldED
  immediately switched the screensaver on after finishing the job.
  Fixed.

+ When using "ORIGIN @path\filename.lst", GoldED now shows a pretty
  [filename.lst] in the origin selection menu instead of the whole
  ugly thing. This will also be done for the other menus later.

- Fixed a bug that caused a certain form of dates in internet msgs to
  be stored incorrectly during SOUP import.

- Fixed wrong file permissions in the Linux version.

- Fixed various bugs that caused core dumps in the Linux version.

- Removed a 500 files limit in the internal editor file selector.

+ Updated AREAFILE TMail support to Terminate 4.00 level (should also
  work for 5.00). Not tested much.

+ Added support for numeric Re's ("Re^n:") in the subject when
  replying. This is controlled with the EDITREPLYRE keyword, which you
  can now set to "NUMERIC" to enable the feature. Stripping of numeric
  Re's is also supported, when EDITREPLYRE is set to NO (the default).

  Example: (with EDITREPLYRE NUMERIC)

    Subj: Hello.
    Subj: Re: Hello.
    Subj: Re^2: Hello.
    Subj: Re^3: Hello.
    etc.

+ Enabled EDITREPLYRE to work in groups as well as globally. Not
  tested.

- In newsgroups and e-mail areas, GoldED now *forces* the use of "Re:"
  in reply subjects, regardless of the EDITREPLYRE setting. The reason
  why it is forced in these areas, is because that is the standard for
  internet mail/news.

! The default logfile name is now GOLDED.LOG for all platforms.

- Fixed the zero-bytes SOUP replies file. This happened when your
  email/news areas were defined as local areas (to prevent being
  scanned out by the mail processor) in, for example, Fastecho, but
  redefined with SOUPEMAIL, AREAISEMAIL, AREAISNEWS and/or
  SOUPNEWSRCFILE. Not tested.

- Fixed crash when commandline option -N was used.

- Fixed zero bytes allocation at [gmxbbs4.cpp,332].

- When the Imm attribute was toggled on, the Hld attribute (if any)
  was not cleared, and vice versa.

- COLOR READER CURSOR now works again.

- The menu to select origins/taglines from a file, named with
  @filename, didn't work well if there were long lines. Additionally,
  the CR/LF characters were not properly stripped. Not tested.

- During the first nodelist lookup, the statusline said "Checking
  nodelists ...", but the previous statusline was not recovered after
  checking. Not tested.

+ Added SEMAPHORE SCANNETMAIL/PMSCANNETMAIL <file>. If GoldED finds
  this semaphore, it will scan or pmscan all netmail areas.

- Fixed -install and AREAFILE Squish for the situation when SET SQUISH
  points to a filename. Works only partially.

- With FRQOPTIONS FAST and AREAFREQDIRECT YES, GoldED did not create
  more than one frq message when there were more files than could fit
  in one subject.

- Some bugs were introduced as a consequence of the separated msgbase
  code: EDITMSGSIZE didn't work. DISPSOFTCR didn't work in JAM areas,
  the -Y debugging commandline parameter didn't work in Hudson,
  Goldbase, JAM, Squish and Fido areas. Logging of msgbase errors and
  warnings was fatally flawed - GoldED would simply crash if such an
  event occurred.

- Fixed the annoying charset translation problem that caused erratic
  translation of ASCII 225 (german sharp s) and other characters, when
  in the presence of LATIN-1. Specifically, the characters were
  translated wrongly when you entered a new message while "on" a
  message with kludge "^aCHRS LATIN-1 2".

- Fixed sound support in GoldED/2. If enabled, it caused a crash
  (SYS3175) when attempting to play a sound, typically the startup
  sound. Not tested.

+ Added support for the new Fastecho 1.46 groups 1-6.

+ In addressmacros and in NAMES.FD, the '@' character is now allowed
  in the macro name.

- Fixed unfree'd allocation at [geread2.cpp,242].

- In the msglist, there were circumstances when double lines appeared
  below the list of messages.

- The replies window was deformed when there was many replies.

+ Added new color definitions for highlightning of unread and unsent
  mail in the messagelist:

  COLOR MENU UNREAD     <colors> When a msg is unread.
  COLOR MENU UNREADHIGH <colors> Additional highlight of to/from.
  COLOR MENU UNSENT     <colors> When a msg is unsent.
  COLOR MENU UNSENTHIGH <colors> Additional highlight of to/from.

  If a msg is both unread and unsent, the unsent colors are used.

  The definition of "unread" in this case is a message where the
  "timesread" field contains the value 0 (zero) or some kind of "seen"
  attribute is not set. See also the description of the new
  HIGHLIGHTUNREAD keyword.

  In msgbases where there is no timesread field or "seen" attribute,
  GoldED currently fakes it and always returns a 1 (one) in the
  timesread field, so that msgs won't be listed as unread all the
  time.

  If the HIGHLIGHTUNREAD keyword is set to NO, the UNREAD colors are
  deactivated.

  These are the defaults:

    COLOR MENU UNREAD       Green on Black
    COLOR MENU UNREADHIGH   White on Black
    COLOR MENU UNSENT       LGrey on Black
    COLOR MENU UNSENTHIGH   LRed  on Black

+ Added new keyword HIGHLIGHTUNREAD <yes/no>. Defaults to NO. If set
  to YES, GoldED updates (increases) the "timesread" field in each
  message that you read. If set to NO, it doesn't touch the message.
  The YES setting causes a slight performance decrease, because the
  header of each message has to be read, the timesread field updated
  and the header written back to disk. The update happens immediately
  after the message is displayed, so you may not notice it at all. A
  message is only updated if the timesread field contains the value 0
  (zero).

  This keyword only works in the following msgbase formats: Fido
  (*.MSG), Hudson, Goldbase, JAM, Squish, Ezycom and AdeptXBBS. In
  Squish and Ezycom, there is no timesread field, but I have annexed a
  reserved message attribute (in Squish, 0x00080000, now called
  MSGSEEN; in Ezycom, extattr 0x80) for the purpose of marking a
  message as read at least once. The other formats (PCBoard, WildCat)
  have no timesread field, but they have reserved fields or attributes
  which *could* be used. Let me know if you want this.

- A bug caused the area description to be used instead of the path in
  a few situations: The GOLDAREA.INC file, the quotebuffer file,
  PCBoard.
